# OpenSats.org

This is the codebase behind [OpenSats.org](https://opensats.org).

## Getting started

The website is a simple [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). To run it locally you'll need Node.js 14.6.0 or newer. After cloning repository try following 3 commands in terminal:

  - `npm run dev` for running a development instance with hot-reloading, file watching and task re-running
  - `npm run build` for compiling the project.
  - `npm start` for starting your app in production mode

If you start the website (either in development or production mode), you can access it on http://localhost:3000

## Codebase organization

  - `docs/projects` hosts Markdown files for all the projects listed on the OpenSats website
  - `utils` folder contains utility functions; `md.ts` is used for rending markdown content into pages using `/pages/projects/[slug].tsx`
    - `[slug].tsx` works by leveraging [getStaticPaths](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching/get-static-paths) and [getStaticProps](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching/get-static-props) functions
  - the rest of the folders are standard for Next.js
    - `pages` contains files that correspond to individual pages on the website 
    - `components` has common UI components used across the project
  - all calls that work with secrets (talking to BTCPay and Stripe) are isolated in server side APIs
    - take a look at `pages/api/btcpay.ts` as an example
