## About this project

Sapio helps you build payment protocol specifiers that oblivious third parties can participate in being none the wiser.

For example, with Sapio you can generate an address that represents a Lightning channel between you and a friend, then give that address to a third-party service like an exchange to have them create the channel without requiring any signature interaction from you or your friend, using zero trusted parties, and an inability to differentiate your address from any other. Thatâ€™s the tip of the iceberg of what Sapio lets you accomplish.

Before Sapio, most Bitcoin smart contracts primarily focused on who could redeem coins when, and what unlocking conditions were required (see Ivy, Policy/Miniscript, etc.). A few languages, such as BitML, emphasized multi-transaction and multi-party use cases. Sapio in particular focuses on transactions using [BIP-119](https://utxos.org/) `OP_CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY`. `OP_CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY` enables Bitcoin Script to support complex multi-step smart contracts without a trusted setup.

Sapio is a tool for easily defining such smart contracts and exporting easy-to-integrate APIs for managing open contracts. With Sapio you can turn what previously would require months or years of careful tinkering with Bitcoin internals into a 20-minute project to get a fully functional Bitcoin application.

Sapio has intelligent built-in features that help developers design safe smart contracts and limit the risk of losing funds.
