## About this project

Cashu is built for Bitcoin and deeply integrated with the Lightning network. Wallets use the mint’s Lightning node for sending and receiving Bitcoin payments anonymously in exchange for ecash. This means that Cashu wallets can be used as regular Bitcoin Lightning wallets but with the added benefit of nearly perfect privacy. A Cashu mint doesn’t know who you are, what your balance is, or who you’re transacting with.

Specifications, called Cashu NUTS (Notation, Usage, and Terminology) describe how to implement the protocol. There are multiple existing client libraries in Python, Typescript, Rust, Golang, Javascript, and Kotlin programming languages, making it easy for developers to write their own wallets. 

Cashu apps:
- Cashu.me wallet
- Nutstash wallet
- Nutshell
