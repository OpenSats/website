## About this project

Damus is a popular nostr client for iOS. The goal of Damus is to integrate
bitcoin with social, and to show the power, censorship resistance, and
scalability of nostr in general.

Damus includes picture and video uploading, is fully translated in 24 languages,
supports automatic translation of notes, and includes all of the features you
would expect from a Twitter-like client.

Damus is a pure nostr client, meaning it does not depend on external services to
function. All it needs is a nostr relay configuration. Many recommended
bootstrap relays are included, but they can be removed and it will only connect
to the relays you configure, enabling strong censorship resistance if the relays
you are using go away or turn evil.

Damus is free and open source software (GPL).
