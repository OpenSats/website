## About this project

Amethyst is the most feature-complete Nostr client for Android. The app offers
three user experiences in one: note feeds, group chats and direct messages, and
media-only feeds (Stories). The application supports both, public and private
relays, and integrates with a vast number of Nostr services and NIPs, including
bounties, zaps/wallet connect, long-form content, badges, file storage systems,
highlights, polls, and lists. It currently has over 50K+ unique downloads and
35K active users.

The app is a crucial component in bringing lightning payments into the everyday
transactions of Android users. It offers a Bitcoin-native messaging tool to
author and distribute content, debate issues, orchestrate teams, and market and
sell services to the most popular mobile operating system out there. This is how
we onboard the real world into Bitcoin. We are here to open the doors of Android
users to every other Nostr project out there.

Within the Nostr ecosystem, our operational strategy is decentralizing by
design. Even though we could run our own relays, algorithms, and added services
into the application, we believe doing that creates a centralizing incentive, an
overly-defensive posture by the team, and must be avoided at all costs. We aim
to support all other Nostr applications and bring their content to the Android
ecosystem as best as possible. By developing Amethyst, we are pushing the Nostr
community to build highly composable and fully decentralized Nostr applications,
powered by zaps.

What Bitcoin solves in money, Nostr and Amethyst solve in communication. If
Bitcoin can take on the FED, nostr can take on "Big Tech".
