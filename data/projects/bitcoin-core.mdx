## About this project

Bitcoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority or
banks; managing transactions and the issuing of bitcoins is carried out
collectively by the network. Bitcoin is open-source; its design is public,
nobody owns or controls Bitcoin and everyone can take part. Through many of its
unique properties, Bitcoin allows exciting uses that could not be covered by any
previous payment system.
