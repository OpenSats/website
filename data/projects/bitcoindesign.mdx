## About this project

We are helping make bitcoin more intuitive and accessible. As bitcoin’s popularity continues to rise, it is essential that everyone be able to participate in this new economy regardless of technical expertise or geography. That can only happen if creators everywhere have the resources and community necessary to foster better bitcoin experiences.

The [Bitcoin Design Community](https://bitcoin.design) [Discord](https://discord.gg/K7aQ5PErht) is an open space to discuss and explore everything bitcoin and design. Open standards are part of our foundation, so all of our work can also be found on [Github](https://github.com/BitcoinDesign). Everyone is welcome to join and participate. You can also [follow](https://bitcoin.design/social-media/) along via our [newsletter](http://bitcoindesign.substack.com), [calendar](https://bitcoin.design/calendar/), social media ([Nostr](nostr:npub13s5mxgws70rpxsug96jfvglggackjrxs2ehypwg0prjaxsek42sqd9l03e), [X](http://twitter.com/bitcoin_design)), [BitcoinTV](https://bitcointv.com/a/bitcoin_design/video-channels) & [YouTube](http://youtube.com/c/BitcoinDesign).

The [Bitcoin Design Guide](https://bitcoin.design/guide/), our primary community project, is a free, open-source repository for anyone building non-custodial bitcoin products. The guide covers consumer wallets with more additions on the way, like merchant interactions, financial applications, and more. If you’d like to help by providing feedback, submitting ideas, or creating content, check out the [contribute page](https://bitcoin.design/guide/contribute/) or join us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/K7aQ5PErht).
