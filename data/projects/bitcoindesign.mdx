## About this project

An open space to discuss and explore everything bitcoin and design. The first community project is the Bitcoin Design Guide, a free and open-source repository for anyone building non-custodial Bitcoin products. Other projects aim to help with things like getting unified QR codes, promoting BOLT 12 adoption, and creating a Bitcoin Icon set.
