GrapheneOS is a private and secure mobile operating system for Android devices
developed as a non-profit open-source project.

As a custom operating system, GrapheneOS improves the privacy and security of
your phone. Built upon the Android Open Source Project (AOSP), it offers a solid
base for privacy-conscious users. Rather than branding and marketing, GrapheneOS
focuses on substance, meaning that security is paramount over unhelpful frills
or third-party app choices.

GrapheneOS offers increased protection from 0-day exploits and other
vulnerabilities due to a reduced attack surface and hardened components.

The core features that GrapheneOS offers its users are:

- Exploit mitigations: hardened app runtime, secure application spawning system, hardened `libc` & a first-party hardened memory allocator, etc.
- Improved sandboxing
- Anti-persistence/detection

Other valuable features include:

- LTE-only mode
- Wi-Fi privacy
- Private screenshots
- PIN scrambling
- Privacy by default
- Longer passwords

The operating system is easy to install on most modern Pixel devices.[^fn-supported-devices]
