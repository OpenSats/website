GrapheneOS improves the privacy and security of the OS, starting from the strong
baseline of the Android Open Source Project (AOSP). Rather than branding and
marketing, GrapheneOS focuses on substance, meaning that security is paramount
over unhelpful frills or third-party app choices.

GrapheneOS offers increased protection from 0-day exploits and other
vulnerabilities due to a reduced attack surface and hardened components.

The core features that GrapheneOS offers its users are:

- Exploit mitigations: hardened app runtime, secure application spawning system, hardened `libc` & a first-party hardened memory allocator, etc.
- Improved sandboxing
- Anti-persistence/detection

Other valuable features include:

- LTE-only mode
- Wi-Fi privacy
- Private screenshots
- PIN scrambling
- Privacy by default
- Longer passwords

The operating system is easy to install on most modern Pixel devices.[^fn-supported-devices]
