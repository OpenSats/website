## About this project

RGB is confidential and scalable client-validated smart contracts system for Bitcoin & Lightning. It embraces concepts of private & mutual ownership, abstraction and separation of concerns and represents "post-blockchain", Turing-complete form of trustless distributed computing which does not require introduction of "tokens" in order to make it operational. RGB is not a token protocol. Though issuance and management of highly scalable, programmable and private assets of different sort is possible with RGB, it can be applied in many industries far beyond financial world, from building DEXs, art ownership rights transfer system, to voting and Digital Identity one.
