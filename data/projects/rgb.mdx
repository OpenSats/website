## About this project

Issuance, burning, secondary issuance, re-issuance, etc. are different forms of rights managed by RGB. As a smart contract system, RGB is quite different from previous Bitcoin-based (Colored coins) and non-bitcoin (Ethereum, EOS) approaches. What sets RGB apart is:
- Separation of the concept of smart contract issuer, state owners, and state evolution
- Smart contract code and data are kept off-chain
- RGB uses blockchain as a state commitment layer and Bitcoin script as an ownership control system 

RGB main properties:
- Confidentiality
- Safety
- Scalability
- No Bitcoin timechain congestion
- Future-ready without hard forks
- Higher censorship resistance than in Bitcoin as miners do not see the activity occurring with assets in the transactions
