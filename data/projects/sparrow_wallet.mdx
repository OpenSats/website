summary: 'Sparrow is a desktop-only Bitcoin wallet for those who value financial self-sovereignty. Sparrowâ€™s emphasis is on security, privacy, and usability. Sparrow does not hide information from you - on the contrary, it attempts to provide as much detail as possible about your transactions and UTXOs, but in a way that is manageable and usable.'
