## About this project

Stratum V2 increases security, makes data transfers more efficient, and reduces mining infrastructure requirements. It also introduces three new sub-protocols that let miners select transaction sets and improve decentralization. Previously, transaction sets were selected by pools. With Stratum V2 the transaction sets are selected by individual miners, leading to a more censorship-resistant network.
