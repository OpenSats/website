## About this project

The Bitcoin and FOSS communities are currently the subject of targeted litigation. The continued threat of litigation serves as a disincentive for contributors to devote their efforts to the advancement of Bitcoin and open-source projects, and hinders their ability to freely and openly discuss the projects and communities to which they contribute. In response, OpenSats has established the OpenSats Legal Defense Fund which aims to defend open-source contributors from lawsuits regarding their activities in the Bitcoin and FOSS ecosystems by directing donations to fund any related legal fees which may arise from their contributions, thereby minimizing the financial repercussions of litigation which can discourage contributors from actively working on and openly discussing Bitcoin and open-source projects.

Applications for the OpenSats Legal Defense Fund Grants will be managed by Open Sats Initiative, Inc., a 501(c)(3) non-profit corporation (EIN: 863904387), and carefully reviewed by the OpenSats Board, who will be responsible for determining grant recipients and amounts by means of a simple (5-4) majority.
