## About this project

BTCPay Server is a self-hosted, open-source cryptocurrency payment processor. It's secure, private, censorship-resistant, and free. Simply launch a server (cloud, your own hardware device, or an existing host), connect your e-commerce store or one of the many apps, and funds arrive directly to your connected wallet. Ability to also facilitate cross-border transactions without conversion fees. Easy to use with native wallet management, and great for invoicing and accounting.
