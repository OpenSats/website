## About this project

How it works:

Interested students apply to a program track (Developer or Designer) based on their background and go through a screening round. Screened students learn how Bitcoin works from a curated set of resources and submit a project proposal. Accepted students contribute to Bitcoin open-source projects. Students who perform exceptionally well are referred for a career in Bitcoin. Over 50K+ lines of open-source code contributed!
