## About this project

RoninDojo develops hardware and software to make it easy for anyone to use bitcoin privately as if it were cash. Some of our products include bitcoin nodes, steel backup plates, powerful software, premium support, and a lot more coming soon. We are working hard to increase accessibility for bitcoin users to connect their wallet to a node, use privacy enhancing coinjoin, do their own self custody, and so much more. Financial sovereignty is our goal and we won't slow down until it is achieved!
