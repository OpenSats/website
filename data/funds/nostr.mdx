The Nostr Fund is a way for you to support the development and
improvement of the Nostr protocol and related software. The fund is made up of
donations from individuals and organizations.

The fund is used to support projects that make Nostr more accessible, secure,
decentralized, and easy to use. It also helps to support projects that educate
people about Nostr and its potential.

The [Nostr Design](/nostr) initiative is made possible thanks to this fund, as
is the financial support of many projects in the [nostr ecosystem](/tags/nostr).

Your donation to *The Nostr Fund* helps support these efforts.
