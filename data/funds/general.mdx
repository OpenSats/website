The OpenSats General Fund is a pool of money that is used to support
Bitcoin-related free and open source projects and contributors. The fund is made
up of donations from individuals and organizations.

Projects that are eligible for funding from the General Fund must meet the
following criteria:

- They must be Bitcoin-related.
- They must be free and open source.
- They must be of high quality and have the potential to make a significant impact on the Bitcoin ecosystem.

The OpenSats Board of Directors reviews all applications for funding from the
General Fund. The Board considers the following factors when making funding
decisions:

- The project's alignment with OpenSats' mission.
- The project's feasibility and potential impact.

- The project's financial need.

The OpenSats General Fund has been used to support a wide variety of
Bitcoin-related projects, including:

OpenSats is a 501(c)(3) public charity that aims to support and maintain a
sustainable ecosystem of funding for free and open-source projects and
contributors, especially Bitcoin related projects and projects which help
Bitcoin flourish.

We believe that free and open-source software is essential to the future of the
internet and the world. It allows people to collaborate and share knowledge,
without being locked into proprietary software or hardware. This is especially
important for Bitcoin, which  relies on the open-source development community to
maintain and improve its software.
