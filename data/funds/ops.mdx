## About this project

Open Sats Initiative, Inc., is a 501(c)(3) non-profit corporation (EIN:
863904387) helping to support and maintain a sustainable ecosystem of funding
for Bitcoin & complimentary-FOSS projects and contributors. 

Unlike most charities, OpenSats doesn't take a cut of any donations to FOSS
projects that we list in order to fund our operational expenses, instead opting
to pass 100% of donations through to the projects themselves. This means that
our (very small) operational budget is 100% funded from generous donors like you
who appreciate our hard work to support free and open source projects in the
Bitcoin space.

You can donate to our operational budget by clicking the donate button on this
page or head over to the [About Us](/about) page to learn more about the
organization and our efforts.
