At OpenSats, we are committed to supporting projects that align with our [mission]
of supporting and maintaining a sustainable ecosystem of funding for free and
open-source projects and contributors, especially Bitcoin-related projects and
projects which help Bitcoin flourish. Our approach to grant-making is
collaborative and interactive. We work with grantees to develop well-crafted
proposals with a clear path toward achieving intended results.

## Grant Size, Complexity, and Risk

Our level of engagement with grantees varies depending on the grant size,
complexity, and risk involved. We will engage in more extensive partnerships and
communication with grantees for larger, more complex grants. Our main goal is to
ensure alignment on priorities, expectations, and progress. We will maintain
good and open communications for smaller grants or those with lower risk too,
but with a lighter touch.

## Partnership and Communication

Appropriate partnership with our grantees is critical to achieving results. We
encourage grantees to communicate openly with us about grant progress,
challenges, and concerns. We commit to doing the same by regularly checking in
with our grantees to ensure we remain aligned on priorities and expectations. We
understand that successful grant-making requires a two-way flow of information,
and we strive to foster a culture of collaboration and communication.

## Our Grant Making Process

Our grant-making process begins with identifying areas of need that align with
our mission. We then develop a clear set of criteria for evaluating proposals,
ensuring they align with our strategic priorities and have a clear path toward
achieving intended results. We consider the applicants' capabilities and ability
to focus, to ensure a good fit with our mission and grant-making priorities.

Once we receive grant proposals, we review them carefully to ensure they meet
our criteria and align with our mission. We may also engage in discussions with
applicants to refine proposals and ensure they are well-crafted and have a clear
path toward achieving intended results. In addition, we work closely with
grantees throughout the grant period. Again, the goal is to monitor progress and
ensure the grant achieves the intended outcomes.

## Our Process for Reviewing Grant Proposals

We are committed to a thorough and rigorous process for reviewing grant
applications and project listings. We aim to ensure that proposals align with
our mission and priorities, are well-crafted, and have a clear path toward
achieving intended outcomes.

Our process consists of 5 steps:

1. [Initial screening](#step-1-initial-screening)
2. [Comprehensive review](#step-2-comprehensive-review)
3. [Due diligence](#step-3-due-diligence)
4. [Final decision](#step-4-final-decision)
5. [Grant agreement and monitoring](#step-5-grant-agreement-and-monitoring)

### Step 1: Initial Screening

We begin our review process with an initial screening of applications to ensure
they align with our mission and priorities. We may also consider the applicant's
capabilities and focus to ensure a good fit. Applications that pass the initial
screening will move on to the next stage of the review process.

### Step 2: Comprehensive Review

In the comprehensive review stage, we take a deeper dive into the proposals to
evaluate them against a clear set of criteria.

The following are our main criteria:

- Alignment with our mission and priorities
- Clarity of goals and objectives
- Feasibility of the proposed project or research
- Capability and expertise of the applicant
- Potential impact and scalability of the project

We may also engage in discussions with the applicants to better understand their
proposal and to ask follow-up questions. This stage aims to identify proposals
that have a clear path toward achieving intended outcomes and align with our
mission. At this stage, we may include domain experts to help us evaluate
relevant open-source work the applicant has done in the past.

### Step 3: Due Diligence

Once we have identified proposals that align with our mission and priorities, we
conduct due diligence to ensure that the proposed project or research is
feasible and that the applicant has the necessary capability and expertise to
execute the project successfully. Due diligence may include reviewing financial
statements and references, as well as discussions with past collaborators and
references of the grantee.

### Step 4: Final Decision

Based on our comprehensive review and due diligence process, we make a final
decision on grant proposals. We consider the overall impact of the proposal, the
potential for scalability, and the capability of the applicant to execute the
project successfully. We may also consider how the grant fits into our broader
portfolio of grants and our overall mission. All grants require majority
approval by our board of directors.

### Step 5: Grant Agreement and Monitoring

Once we have made a final decision, we work with grantees to develop a grant
agreement outlining the grant's scope, milestones, and reporting requirements.
We monitor progress closely to ensure that the grant is achieving the intended
outcomes and that the grantee is using the funds responsibly.

## Conclusion

At OpenSats, we are committed to a thorough and rigorous review process for
grant proposals. Our process ensures that proposals align with our mission and
priorities, are well-crafted, and have a clear path toward achieving intended
outcomes. We do our best to work with grantees to ensure that proposals are
feasible, impactful, and scalable, and we monitor the grant progress closely to
ensure that grants achieve the intended outcomes.
