## What are you doing at OpenSats?

**Open Sats Initiative, Inc. (EIN 85-2722249) is a 501(c)(3) public charity which
aims to fund Bitcoin-related free and open-source projects and associated
education and research initiatives.**

We want to see contributors to Bitcoin Core and FOSS (free and open-source)
tools supported by a sustainable ecosystem and consistent funding, so we set up
an initiative to do just that. Donors can come to the OpenSats website and
either recommend gifts to specific project areas or contribute to our general
fund.

We distribute grants to a wide variety of contributor types (developers,
designers, researchers, educators, reviewers...), but only to those working on
Bitcoin and open-source projects that will improve public access to Bitcoin
infrastructure.

## How are funds distributed?

Donations to the general fund will be distributed periodically by our board. We
evaluate and assess applications to make sure any grants are awarded to high
impact projects in the Bitcoin space.

You can find a list of past and active grantees, as well as links to our reports
at our [transparency](/transparency) section.

## How much of my donation goes towards open-source contributors?

100%. All donations to our open-source funds go in full to OpenSats grant
recipients. We do not take a cut from donations and try our best to find donor
matching partners that cover the transaction fees that incur with each donation,
regardless of payment method.

Please [reach out] if you want to help us cover these costs.

[reach out]: mailto:support@opensats.org

## Do you distribute grants in bitcoin or fiat?

We only distribute grants in bitcoin.

We accept donations in fiat currency, but they are transferred to our exchange
partner and used to purchase bitcoin. The bitcoin is then held and eventually
distributed to grant recipients.

## How do you collect bitcoin donations?

We use BTCPay Server to collect bitcoin donations, both on-chain and lightning.
This ensures that we pay as little fees as possible so your funds are stretched
even farther.

## How can I communicate with you?

The best way to [contact us](/contact) is via email:

- support@opensats.org

You can also write to us at:

```
Open Sats Initiative, Inc. 
42041 Cypress Parkway #4-207 
Punta Gorda, FL 33982
```

## How often are funding opportunities announced?

Funding opportunities are announced as they arise, depending on funding
availability. Projects that align with [our mission statement][mission] are
encouraged to apply. Board members evaluate each application based on technical
merit, potential impact, and the team's ability to execute.

All projects should be free and open-source and related to Bitcoin or an
ancillary technology (like Tor, etc.) which helps Bitcoin use. Your project must
align with the mission of our charity to be eligible for donations.

## How do I apply for funding?

Any project that is free and open-source and is aligned with the OpenSats
mission is free to [submit an application](/apply).

All applications which fulfill the [criteria](/apply#criteria) will be evaluated
by [the Board][board]. Upon board approval and collection of necessary
supplemental data, approved projects might be showcased on the OpenSats website.
Please refer to our dedicated [Application FAQ](/faq/application) for additional
information pertaining to applications.

## When is the best time to apply?

We are continually evaluating applications and are reviewing grant proposals as
described in our [grant selection](/selection) process.

You are free to apply at any time except for the months of March, June,
September, and December, where we close applications to make internal
improvements and do some housekeeping.

If you are helping Bitcoin and FOSS, please [submit an application](/apply) on
our website.

## How did you choose the board?

We didn't want any one person or small group to have control of the decision
making process of OpenSats, so we created a transparent, public-facing, and
accountable nine person board to make all organizational decisions.

OpenSats' board members have deep-seated values and will stop at nothing to
support and ensure the survival of free and open-source technology like Bitcoin.

[The board][board] is composed of well-known and respected public-facing
individuals who will carry the torch and be held accountable for their choices.
We encourage community feedback, dialogue, and constructive criticism. We can
only promise to do our best to ensure that all funds go to deserving projects
which support OpenSats' mission of creating a sustainable and consistent
ecosystem of funding for Bitcoin and Bitcoin-related FOSS contributors.

## Do board members benefit financially from donations?

No. Board members are not compensated for their board member duties and do not
benefit from donations given to our funds. Board member duties are performed on
a volunteer basis.

## Tell me more about your board. How does it work?

We have [nine board members][board] and we vote by majority. All standard
decisions (like which new projects are added to the website or which projects
will receive grants allocated from the general fund) are made by simple majority
(5-4), while board-related changes will require 6-3 majority. New members to the
board will be announced publicly.

## Are you really 100% passthrough?

Yes, really. We have an operational budget to cover lawyers, accountants, and
basic operational costs, but they aren't paid from your donations to projects.
Our operational costs are covered by generous donors who regularly donate to our
[Operations Budget][ops].

- John Pfeffer, Greg Foss, Ten31, #startsmall, and The Bitcoin Company have contributed to our legal and operational overhead or contributed technical development resources so OpenSats can stay 100% passthrough for all donations directed to our General Fund and Nostr Fund.
- BTCPay Server is a FOSS tool we use to accept bitcoin with no fees.
- River provides our bitcoin exchange services with no added fees.
- Unchained provides our multi-sig custody services with no fees.

We are committed to remaining a 100% passthrough operation, meaning that we are
passing on 100% of donations made to our funds to open-source contributors. To
this day our operational, legal, and payment processing fees have been
graciously and privately funded.

Please [consider donating][ops] to the Operations Budget which will help cover
our basic operational expenses (which we have kept to a minimum) so we can
ensure that all donations intended for Bitcoin and FOSS projects remain 100%
passthrough.

## Are my donations tax deductible?

Yes, Open Sats Initiative, Inc. (EIN 85-2722249) is a 501(c)(3) non-profit
organization. All gifts and donations are tax-deductible to the full extent of
the law.

If you would like to receive a tax deduction, we may need to collect
supplementary information like your name and email for required recordkeeping
purposes.

OpenSats relies on donors like you to help promote and support a sustainable
ecosystem of contributors to Bitcoin and related free and open-source projects.
We greatly appreciate your contributions.
