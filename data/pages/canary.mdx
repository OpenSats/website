# Don't trust, verify

1. Import Gigi's [PGP key](/about/dergigi#pgp-key):

```bash
curl https://opensats.org/docs/dergigi.pub.asc | gpg --import
```

2. Download the [signed canary statement][scs]
3. Verify the signature: 

```bash
gpg --auto-key-retrieve --verify canary.txt.asc
```

4. You should get an output that is similar to the following (make sure to check
the date that the canary was signed):

```bash
gpg: Signature made Wed  7 Aug 23:30:46 2024 WEST
gpg:                using RSA key 8198A18530A522A09561243989C4A25E69A5DE7F
gpg: Good signature from "Gigi D. <gigi@opensats.org>" [ultimate]
```
Unless you've taken steps to build a trust path to Gigi's key, you will see a similar warning as below. However, it can be disregarded if you've gotten "Good signature".

```bash
gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
Primary key fingerprint: 8198 A185 30A5 22A0 9561  2439 89C4 A25E 69A5 DE7F
```

Alternatively, you can use the [keybase](https://keybase.io/verify) to verify the signed message.

Stay safe everyone, and keep building.
