Our [mission] is to maintain a sustainable ecosystem of funding for free and
open-source projects and contributors, especially bitcoin-related projects and
protocols that help bitcoin flourish. We believe that nostr is such a protocol.
Like bitcoin, it is an open protocol that has the potential to revolutionize the
way we think about individual sovereignty and liberty.

To aid the various development efforts that are being made in this strange new
world, we created *The Nostr Fund* to provide funding for open-source projects
in the nostr ecosystem. If you would like to join us in helping with these
efforts, please reach out to us or [donate to the
fund](https://opensats.org/projects/nostr).

If you are an open-source developer working on notes and other stuff transmitted
by relays, don't hesitate to [apply for funding][apply].
