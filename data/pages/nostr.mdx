Our [mission] is to maintain a sustainable ecosystem of funding for free and
open-source projects and contributors, especially bitcoin-related projects and
protocols that help bitcoin flourish. We believe that nostr is such a protocol.
Like bitcoin, it is an open protocol that has the potential to revolutionize the
way we think about individual sovereignty and liberty.

To aid the various development efforts that are being made in this strange new
world, we created *The Nostr Fund* to provide funding for open-source projects
in the nostr ecosystem. If you would like to join us in helping with these
efforts, please reach out to us or [donate to the
fund](https://opensats.org/projects/nostr).

If you are an open-source developer working on notes and other stuff transmitted
by relays, don't hesitate to [apply for funding][apply].

## Nostr Design

In addition to providing funding to projects, we offer to help with design work
if your open-source project needs it.

Part of these efforts is [nostrdesign.org](https://nostrdesign.org/), a
comprehensive resource offering product design considerations, design
principles, and best practices that will help developers solve the unique user
experience challenges that nostr poses.

In addition to nostrdesign.org, three of our grantees are dedicating time to help
projects that need help with design and general UI/UX improvements.

The first one is [Karnage], who brings a lot of experience and expertise from
the world of bitcoin product design. Karnage was involved in the development of
multiple nostr clients and is the brain behind *Hey Nostr* and
*Nostr Apps*.

The second one is [Daniele], who is
actively involved in the design of major clients, most notably Gossip and
Coracle, as well as various tools such as the static content gateway that is
part of *nostr.com*.

The third one is [Niel], who is an Industrial Designer who is now bringing his
years of making beautiful and convincing presentations for his designs to the
world of nostr UI & UX.

## Need Help?
