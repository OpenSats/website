As stated in our [mission](/mission), OpenSats is a
501(c)(3) public charity that aims to support and maintain a sustainable
ecosystem of funding for free and open-source projects and contributors.

As opposed to most other charities, OpenSats does not take a cut from funds
raised for open-source projects. This means that all donations to the [general
fund](/projects/general_fund) and specific, mission-aligned
[FOSS projects](/projects) are 100% passed through to
OpenSats grant recipients. We try our best to find donor-matching partners that
cover the transaction fees that are incurred with each donation, regardless of
payment method. Please [reach out](mailto:support@opensats.org) if you want to
help us cover these costs. We are actively looking for organizations / sponsors who would be excited to help cover processing fees (~3%) for donations via credit/debit cards and/or on-chain / routing fees for donations via the bitcoin and lightning networks.

We are committed to being 100% passthrough for all donations made on our
platform. To this day, our operational, legal, and payment processing fees have
been graciously and privately funded by our [generous donors](https://os-website-git-team-open-sats.vercel.app/support#supporters).

Please consider donating to our [Operations
Budget](/projects/opensats_operations_budget), which helps cover our basic
operational expenses (which we try to keep to a minimum) so we can ensure that
all donations intended for Bitcoin and FOSS projects remain 100% passthrough.
