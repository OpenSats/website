As stated in our [mission](/mission), OpenSats is a
501(c)(3) public charity that aims to support and maintain a sustainable
ecosystem of funding for free and open-source projects and contributors.

As opposed to most other charities, OpenSats does not take a cut from funds
raised for open-source projects. This means that all donations to the [general
fund](/projects/general_fund) and specific, mission-aligned
[FOSS projects](/projects) are 100% passed through to
OpenSats grant recipients. We try our best to find donor-matching partners that
cover the transaction fees that are incurred with each donation, regardless of
payment method. Please [reach out](mailto:support@opensats.org) if you want to
help us cover these costs.

We are committed to being 100% passthrough for all donations made on our
platform. To this day, our operational, legal, and payment processing fees have
been graciously and privately funded.

Please consider donating to the [OpenSats Operations
Budget](/projects/opensats_operations_budget), which helps
cover our basic operational expenses (which we try to keep to a minimum) so we
can ensure that all donations intended for Bitcoin and FOSS projects remain 100%
passthrough.

# Supporters

We got an incredible amount of support over the years, both from individuals and
companies alike. We love Bitcoin and open-source, and it warms our hearts that
some members of these communities love us right back.
