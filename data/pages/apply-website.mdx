## Thanks for your interest in OpenSats!

We're incredibly grateful to contributors like you working to support Bitcoin,
nostr, and other free and open-source projects.

Because OpenSats is a [501(c)(3) non-profit][about], all applications must be
vetted by our board of directors to ensure that they help us further our
[mission] of supporting contributors to Bitcoin, nostr, and related free and
open-source projects.

Additionally, OpenSats must support specific PROJECTS which help to further our
charitable mission. As such, if you are an individual contributor, please be
sure that you list a SPECIFIC PROJECT you are working on.

The information collected below will be used in order to vet your project. If
approved, OpenSats will create a project page on our [projects page][pp] where
visitors can learn more about your project and donate if they choose to.  Your
project will be listed for one year. After one year, you will be prompted to
re-send your application should you wish to be listed again.

We also distribute grants from our [general fund][gf] and you may also choose to
apply for a grant below.

## Criteria

Bitcoin: We prioritize projects that will have a direct impact on the utility or
adoption of Bitcoin. We will consider all projects but prefer projects that are
not readily funded and which have an obvious benefit to the Bitcoin community
and ecosystem. Potential projects include Bitcoin Core contributions,
scientific/security research, code review, design/UX improvements, etc.

Free and Open-Source: OpenSats supports free and open-source software, tools,
and contributors which complement Bitcoin and help Bitcoin reach its
fullest potential. Potential areas of interest include secure messaging,
merchant acceptance tools, layer two protocols, etc. Source code and documents
resulting from funded projects must be made publicly available for access, edit,
and redistribution free of charge and without restrictions.

Education and Mentorship: Funded contributors and projects should be prepared to
share their experience and expertise with the greater community. We prefer
developers who actively engage in mentorship, and help introduce Bitcoin
software development to newcomers.

If your project is selected to be listed, we will reach out with any additional
information necessary to ensure you are able to receive donation payouts. This
may include tax related information depending on your location and/or bitcoin
addresses in order to receive donation payouts from OpenSats.
