### What kind of projects is OpenSats interested in funding?

All applications should be made with the following criteria in mind:

- Good for Bitcoin
- Free and Open-Source
- Transparency & Education

Refer to our [application criteria](/apply#criteria) for more details.

### What projects do we NOT fund?

We don't fund any shitcoin projects or anything detrimental to Bitcoin. Anything
that is closed source is off the table too.

### When can I apply for a grant?

Applications are open for the first two months of each quarter and closed in
March, June, September, and December.

### How long will it take to evaluate my application?

We strive to evaluate all applications in less than 90 days, but occasionally,
it can take longer.

### How will I know if my application was selected or not?

You will be notified via email.[^fn-shitcoins]

### In which currency should I denominate my grant application?

All grants are denominated in USD, please propose your budget in USD.

### How should I determine the budget for my application?

As each applicant will have different circumstances, budgets can vary
substantially. We suggest that you consider your cost of living, the value of
your time, and taxes when applying for a grant.

### Can I receive [insert fiat currency]?

No. All grants are denominated in USD but paid in bitcoin. We will request
on-chain addresses as part of the grant process.

### Can OpenSats help me with an accounting or legal question?

We have hundreds of grantees worldwide and do not have the capacity or the
liberty to provide accounting or legal advice across so many different
jurisdictions. We recommend asking a local accountant or lawyer in your
jurisdiction.

### Can the grant be received as a company, trust, LLC, or similar?

Yes. We suggest working with your accountant or a similar professional if you
need help setting up an entity and/or filling out the appropriate tax forms. You
can also receive the grant as an individual. If your grant is approved, the email 
notification will contain information on what tax form we need from you in each case.

### Why do you require tax information from your grantees?

We are a 501(c)(3) public charity registered in Texas, USA. We are required by
law to collect this information.

### What are the requirements of OpenSats grants?

The general requirements are as follows:

- Work produced must be published under a free and open-source license.
- Submit a progress report every 90 days for the duration of the grant.
- That's essentially it!

Footnote: If you're a lawyer, please refer to the fine print in our [grant
agreement](/transparency).

### What does it mean to produce work under a free and open-source license?

We expect both code and educational materials to be published under a [free and
open-source license][gnu] and produced in the open. That means frequent, public
commits to GitHub (or equivalent).

[gnu]: https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html

Writing all your code/educational materials in private, even if you plan to
publish them later, is not compliant with our grant agreement.

### Can grants be part-time or only full-time?

Grants can be full-time or part-time. We can accommodate different levels of
commitment with corresponding levels of financial support.

### How can I increase my funding chances?

- Have Proof of Work in the Bitcoin and/or nostr ecosystems.
- Ask for funding for a project you have already started working on, with Proof
  of Work.
- Be humble.

### If my application is rejected, can I reapply?

Yes. We suggest:

- Putting in more Proof of Work
- Improving your application
- Consider applying for a shorter grant of 3 or 6 months

If you would like feedback on why your application was rejected, contact us at
[support@opensats.org](mailto:support@opensats.org).

### Can anyone apply?

We cannot fund grants related to countries or programs on the [OFAC Sanctions
Program and Country
Information](https://ofac.treasury.gov/sanctions-programs-and-country-information)
list.

### What should I do if I have general praise or criticism regarding OpenSats?

If you have something good to say about us, you are welcome to say it publicly
and tag us on
[nostr](https://njump.me/npub10pensatlcfwktnvjjw2dtem38n6rvw8g6fv73h84cuacxn4c28eqyfn34f).

If you have something that irks you and/or suggestions for improvements, please
let us know via support@opensats.org. We are learning as we go, so any
feedback is highly appreciated.

### I have a question that isn't covered here; what do I do?

Have a look at the [General FAQ](/faq). Your question might be answered there.

All application-related inquiries should be sent to support@opensats.org.
Please refer to our [contact page](/contact) for additional details.

[^fn-shitcoins]: If your application is spam or shitcoin related, you will not receive a notification as these applications do not meet our funding criteria. You can safely assume your application was rejected.
