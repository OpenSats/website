At OpenSats, we allocate funds from our generous donors to developers and
educators working on free and open-source projects in the Bitcoin and Nostr
ecosystems. Supporting our grantees is foundational to what we do. The OpenSats
[operations team](/about#operations) is available to address
any concerns, questions, and unforeseen circumstances that may arise. We have an
open communication channel via
[support@opensats.org](mailto:support@opensats.org). Please use this email for
any inquiries.

Don’t hesitate to contact us anytime. Whenever possible, please let us know in
advance of any change of circumstances that may affect your work under your
OpenSats grant. Within reason, we will do our best to adjust and respond to any
changes so that you can continue building under sustainable conditions.

### I have a question; whom should I email?

All inquiries should be sent to support@opensats.org. Do not email or DM individuals,
or else our response may be delayed.[^fn-delay]

[^fn-delay]: Seriously. Depending on the individual, said delay might be weeks or months. Please only use the official channels as per [opensats.org/contact][c]

### When will I receive my first grant payment?

Grant payments are made on the 15th of the month, give or take a day or two.

### Can I receive [insert fiat currency]?

No. All grants are paid in sats, i.e. bitcoin. We will request on-chain
addresses as part of the grant process.

### Can the grant be received as a company, trust, LLC, or similar?

Yes. We suggest working with your accountant or a similar professional if you
need help with setting up an entity and/or filling out the appropriate tax
forms. You can also receive the grant as an individual. The congratulations
email we sent you contains information on what tax form we need from you in each
case.  
  
### Why do you require tax information from your grantees?

We are a 501(c)(3) public charity registered in the state of Texas. We are
required by law to collect this information.

### Can OpenSats help me with an accounting or legal question?

We have hundreds of grantees across the globe and do not have the capacity or
the liberty to provide accounting or legal advice across so many different
jurisdictions. We recommend asking a local accountant or lawyer in your
jurisdiction.

### What are the requirements of my grant?

The general requirements are as follows:

- Work produced must be published under a free and open-source license.
- Submit a progress report every 90 days for the duration of the grant.

That’s basically it![^fn-legal]

[^fn-legal]: As a public charity, we have to check various boxes on our side. Please refer to our grant agreement for any other details, linked at [opensats.org/transparency](/transparency)

### How does OpenSats evaluate the work done by a grantee?

Every grantee must submit a progress report every 90 days. A markdown template
is provided when we request your first report.

If your grant started in January, for example, the 1st report will be due anytime during the month of April and should cover the work done from January thru March, and so on and so forth. You have a 30-day window to work on the report and we appreciate if you keep them on schedule.

Reports are evaluated by:

- A technical committee
- One or multiple board members
- At least one person from our operations team

In addition to the 90-day progress reports, we monitor public repositories to
evaluate progress.

### What does an ideal progress report look like?

An ideal progress report is:

- Written in Markdown format
- Between 1 and 3 pages
- Enriched with links to pull requests, commits, and other relevant work produced.

Every progress report should show clearly the connection between what was
planned in the application or previous report(s) and the work done since.

We encourage you to openly discuss any obstacles that may have prevented you
from reaching previously established milestones, and/or why your previously
outlined plans changed. Remember that we're here to help, not to judge.

### Does OpenSats provide feedback on every progress report submitted?

Not necessarily. We review all reports, but this work is mostly done by a team
of volunteers with technical expertise in the area of your project. Given the
nature of this volunteer work, there is not a set schedule for this review to
happen, so please do not expect feedback for every report, immediate or not.

We will contact you if we have any questions or concerns about your report.

### What happens if the deliverables, milestones, or timelines proposed in the application are changed or not delivered?

Software development is inherently unpredictable. If you make changes to your
project, explain the reasoning clearly in your progress reports and keep on
building!

### Is it okay to work on something that isn’t part of the grant agreement or even pivot to another project?

The short answer is yes, within reason. Your work must be aligned with [our
mission](/mission) and meet our criteria of being free and open-source within
the Bitcoin and/or Nostr ecosystems.

[Reach out to us][c] if you'd like to explore this option further.

### I wasn’t able to work on my project as much as I expected, what should I do?

[Reach out to us][c] to discuss the best path forward as soon as possible.

### Can I pause my grant?

Yes. Let us know the duration of the pause before taking a break.

### Do I need to track hours?

No. Our expectation is that grantees will work on deliverables and milestones
listed in their grant agreement in an honest manner and on a best-effort basis.
Grantees have the flexibility to manage their workload as they see fit.

Work done should be reflected in each progress report. Just be honest.

Taking a few days, weekends, and evenings off is perfectly fine and encouraged.
We shouldn’t have to write this, but past experience forces us to be explicit
about it: **Please do not sacrifice your health and well-being.** We encourage
our grantees to do good work that is aligned with our mission, but we also
encourage you to live a balanced life. Do not burn yourself to a crisp.

As mentioned above, if you need to pause a grant to take extended time off, let
us know as soon as possible and we’ll do our best to find a solution that works
for you and us.

### How can I best ensure that OpenSats is getting a good return on investment?

Some grantees feel pressure to provide ROI to OpenSats. Do not think about it
this way - we are not a VC fund; we are not making investments. We expect you to
do good, honest work.

We select people who are aligned with our mission and values, and we trust that
the rest will fall into place. Our expectation is that you're acting in good
faith.

### Does my grant renew automatically?

No, each grant has a set end date listed in the grant agreement. If you would
like to apply for another grant, consider applying 60-90 days before the end of
your current grant in order to give us enough time to evaluate and process your
application.

### Is it possible to renew or extend my grant?

Yes. However, we consider it a new grant, not an extension. All grants must go
through the same evaluation process - start by applying again at
[opensats.org/apply](/apply).

As mentioned above, consider applying for a new grant 60-90 days before the end
of your current grant in order to give us enough time to evaluate and process
your application.

### Can grants be part-time or only full-time?

Grants can be full-time or part-time. We can accommodate many different levels
of commitment with corresponding levels of financial support.

### Can a full-time grant be turned into a part-time grant?

If you are partway through a full-time grant and want to reduce your time
commitment, [reach out to us][c]. We can discuss adjusting your grant based on a
smaller time commitment.

### What should I do at the end of my grant?

Send in your final progress report.

### I have general praise or criticism regarding OpenSats. What should I do?

If you have something good to say about us, feel free to say it publicly and tag
us [on nostr][njump].

If you have something that irks you or any suggestions for improvements, please
let us know via support@opensats.org. We are learning as we go, so any feedback
is highly appreciated.

Thank you!
