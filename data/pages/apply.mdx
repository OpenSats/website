## Thanks for your interest in OpenSats!

We're incredibly grateful to contributors like you working to support Bitcoin,
nostr, and other free and open-source projects.

Because OpenSats is a [501(c)(3) non-profit][about], all applications must be
vetted by our board of directors to ensure that they help us further our
[mission] of supporting contributors to Bitcoin, nostr, and related free and
open-source projects.

We also distribute grants from our [general fund][gf] and you may also choose to
apply for a grant below.

## Criteria

All applications should be made with the following criteria in mind:

- Good for Bitcoin
- Free and Open-Source
- Transparency & Education

Our [grant selection process][gsp] involves the evaluation of multiple criteria,
but these three are crucial for any successful application.

**Bitcoin:** We prioritize projects that will have a direct impact on the utility or
adoption of Bitcoin. We will consider all projects but prefer projects that are
not readily funded and which have an obvious benefit to the Bitcoin community
and ecosystem. Potential projects include Bitcoin Core contributions,
scientific/security research, code review, design/UX improvements, etc.

**Free and Open-Source:** OpenSats supports free and open-source software, tools,
and contributors which complement Bitcoin and help Bitcoin reach its
fullest potential. Potential areas of interest include secure messaging,
merchant acceptance tools, layer two protocols, etc. Source code and documents
resulting from funded projects must be made publicly available for access, edit,
and redistribution free of charge and without restrictions. Your project MUST
HAVE a proper [open-source license][license] & educational materials must be available to
the public under an open license.

**Transparency & Education:** Funded contributors and projects should be prepared to
share their experience and expertise with the greater community. We prefer
developers who actively engage in mentorship, and help introduce Bitcoin
software development to newcomers.

If your application is approved, we will reach out with any additional
information necessary to ensure you are able to receive donation payouts. This
may include tax related information depending on your location and/or bitcoin
addresses in order to receive donation payouts from OpenSats.
