## OpenSats Design Initiative

Are you an open-source developer in need of design guidance? Do you need help
with reviewing the UX of your software? Are you working on something that could
benefit from [#nostrdesign](https://nostrdesign.org/) or the [Bitcoin Design
Community](/projects/bitcoindesign)?

Don't hesitate to reach out to design@opensats.org

Are you interested in partnering with OpenSats? Do you provide services that
could help us improve our [donation flow](/donate) or [grant
programs](/apply)? Do you align with [our
mission](/mission) and want to join us in supporting freedom
tech for the long term?

Please send us your proposal at partnerships@opensats.org

## Want to Help?

You can join our growing [team of

There are plenty of things to do, and _many hands make light work_, as the
saying goes. Interested?
