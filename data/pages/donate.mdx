# Donate to Operations Budget

We don't take a cut from donations to open-source projects. Consequently, we
have to raise money for our operational expenses separately. Please donate to
our [Operations Budget][ob] to keep OpenSats alive.

If you would like to facilitate a substantial donation or support us on a
recurring basis, please reach out to donate@opensats.org.

# Donate via Donor-Advised Fund

You can donate to OpenSats via a donor-advised fund. To quote our friends from [Brink][brink]:

> A [donor-advised fund (DAF)][daf] is a private fund administered by a third party and
> created for the purpose of managing charitable donations on behalf of an
> organization, family, or individual.
>
> DAFs have become increasingly popular, primarily because they offer the donor
> greater ease of administration, while still allowing the donor to maintain
> significant control over the placement and distribution of charitable gifts. In
> addition, companies are able to offer this service to clients at a lower cost
> than if the funds were handled privately.

There are several benefits to donating through a DAF:
- It allows the donor to better manage their tax burden. For example, the donor may choose to donate a large sum to maximize deductions in one tax year, and then spread out their charitable giving from the fund over multiple years.
- Any growth in the value of the fund is tax exempt.
- It’s easy to donate [Bitcoin][daf-btc] (or other appreciated assets) to the fund while not incurring capital gains tax.

By donating Bitcoin through your DAF, you will receive the tax-deductible
benefit for the value of the Bitcoin, but Brink will receive USD, not Bitcoin.
For more details, please contact your DAF portfolio manager.

The three largest DAFs are  [Fidelity
Charitable](https://www.fidelitycharitable.org/),  [Schwab
Charitable](https://www.schwabcharitable.org/)  and  [BNY Mellon Charitable Gift
Fund](https://bnymelloncharitablegiftfund.org/bnym/). All three can accept
Bitcoin donations.

If you have an established account with one of the above-mentioned funds, then
you can  [donate directly to OpenSats through your DAF][daf-direct].

If you’d like to learn more about the ways a DAF fund might be useful in your
giving portfolio, contact donate@opensats.org or the investment manager of your
DAF.
