# Donor-Advised Funds

You can donate to OpenSats via a donor-advised fund. To quote our friends from [Brink][brink]:

> A [donor-advised fund (DAF)][daf] is a private fund administered by a third party and
> created for the purpose of managing charitable donations on behalf of an
> organization, family, or individual.
>
> DAFs have become increasingly popular, primarily because they offer the donor
> greater ease of administration, while still allowing the donor to maintain
> significant control over the placement and distribution of charitable gifts. In
> addition, companies are able to offer this service to clients at a lower cost
> than if the funds were handled privately.

There are several benefits to donating through a DAF:
- It allows the donor to better manage their tax burden. For example, the donor may choose to donate a large sum to maximize deductions in one tax year, and then spread out their charitable giving from the fund over multiple years.
- Any growth in the value of the fund is tax exempt.
- It’s easy to donate [bitcoin][daf-btc] (or other appreciated assets) to the fund while not incurring capital gains tax.

By donating bitcoin through your DAF, you will receive the tax-deductible
benefit for the value of the bitcoin. Our preferred DAF partner is [Unchained
donor-advised funds][unchained], since the bitcoin DAFs are on-chain, meaning donations to
the DAF and grants to OpenSats can remain in bitcoin.

With traditional DAFs, OpenSats will receive USD, not bitcoin. For more details,
please contact your DAF portfolio manager.

The three largest traditional DAFs are  [Fidelity
Charitable](https://www.fidelitycharitable.org/),  [Schwab
Charitable](https://www.schwabcharitable.org/)  and  [BNY Mellon Charitable Gift
Fund](https://bnymelloncharitablegiftfund.org/bnym/). All three can accept
bitcoin donations, but will sell the bitcoin donations as soon as they are received.

If you have an established account with one of the above-mentioned funds, then
you can  [donate directly to OpenSats through your DAF][daf-direct].

If you’d like to learn more about the ways a DAF fund might be useful in your
giving portfolio, contact donate@opensats.org or the investment manager of your
DAF.

# Donate to Operations Budget

We don't take a cut from donations to open-source projects. Consequently, we
have to raise money for our operational expenses separately. Please donate to
our [Operations Budget][ob] to keep OpenSats alive.
