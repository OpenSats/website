summary: "OpenSats is funding nine more open-source projects in the nostr ecosystem."
---

Nostr continues to flourish as a transformative, censorship-resistant
alternative for building natively social services and applications. With a
growing ecosystem of projects, users, and infrastructure, it’s becoming easier
and easier to leverage nostr's architecture, social graph, and web-of-trust to
create solutions that put the user in control.

While it might not be obvious to outsiders, nostr has already evolved beyond its
initial perception as a clone of existing social media platforms. Being a
foundational protocol for self-sovereign identity and trust-minimized web
infrastructure, a multitude of applications are being built on top of it. The
potential use cases of nostr are vast and continually expanding, and we can’t
wait to see what will be built in the months and years to come as the world is
shifting more and more towards a nostr-based web.

In this sixth wave of nostr grants, we are excited to highlight nine projects
that are at the forefront of this shift. These projects are:

- [Osty](#osty)
- [Seer](#seer)
- [Alphaama](#alphaama)
- [Corny Chat](#corny-chat)
- [Nostroots](#nostroots)
- [Yana](#yana)
- [Dart NDK](#dart-ndk)
- [Jester](#jester)
- [Nostr Spring Boot Starter](#nostr-spring-boot-starter)

Our support for nostr is made possible by generous donors like you. If you would
like to help us continue supporting the nostr ecosystem, consider making a
donation to [The Nostr Fund](/funds/nostr):

Let's take a closer look at these projects and how they align with our mission.

### Osty

[Osty](https://osty.dev/) is a free and open-source framework designed to
streamline the development of web applications on the nostr protocol. It offers
a comprehensive toolkit akin to [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) but tailored for
nostr, including UI components, widgets, NDK, and essential features like
caching, routing, and state management. Osty aims to enhance both the
development and team collaboration experience, providing templates for popular
frameworks such as React, Vue, and Svelte. The project focuses on facilitating
rapid app development from concept to production, with an emphasis on
scalability, design patterns, safety, and performance. Future plans include
evolving Osty into a no-code platform, enabling users with no coding skills to
create customized nostr apps easily, and potentially incorporating AI for app
creation based on prompts.

### Seer

[Seer](https://github.com/Galaxoid-Labs/Seer#) is an open-source application
designed for group communication and management within nostr’s protocol using
[NIP-29](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/29.md). Built with
Swift, Seer is optimized for macOS, iOS, iPadOS, and potentially visionOS,
providing a native user experience similar to Apple Mail. The project aims to
fill the gap in robust, platform-native nostr applications, offering seamless
group communication and easy-to-deploy relay scripts for NIP-29-based groups.
The project's goals include completing the macOS version, developing iOS and
iPadOS versions, and creating one-click deploy scripts for relays. Future plans
involve expanding to other platforms like Windows, Linux, and Android.

### Alphaama

[Alphaama](https://alphaama.com/) is an open-source nostr client that combines a
command-line interface with a graphical user interface, offering a highly
customizable and flexible platform. Designed as a research project into UI/UX
possibilities, alphaama encourages users to explore and modify its codebase,
promoting privacy and user empowerment by giving full control over how users
interact with nostr. The project aims to expose the inner workings of the
protocol, providing an educational tool for newcomers and a creative playground
for developers. Ongoing development includes new features and enhancements, with
a focus on challenging conventional software design paradigms and inspiring
unique approaches to decentralized network applications.

### Corny Chat

[Corny Chat](https://cornychat.com/) is an open-source audio spaces platform
akin to Twitter Spaces or Clubhouse. It was forked from [Jam
Systems](https://github.com/jam-systems/jam) and extended to directly integrate
with nostr. The project aims to provide a decentralized, privacy-respecting
alternative for audio discussions, supporting features like
[NIP-07](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/07.md) logins,
lightning payments, and customizable user profiles. Future enhancements include
live chat, event scheduling, and room management features, making Corny Chat a
vital tool for fostering community engagement and anonymous participation within
the nostr ecosystem. The project is part of a broader effort to integrate FOSS
applications with nostr, promoting greater adoption and flexibility. Key
milestones include adding support for live activities and audio streams, as well
as expanding functionality with custom emojis and room management tools.

### Nostroots

[Nostroots](https://github.com/Trustroots/nostroots) is an initiative to migrate
[Trustroots.org](http://trustroots.org)—a social network with over 100,000
members—onto the nostr protocol. Trustroots offers a platform similar to
Couchsurfing with an
alternative and more decentralized approach. The project aims to introduce its
users to public/private key technology and expand its use cases beyond
hospitality, including potential projects like a nostr-based ride-sharing app.
The transition to nostr seeks to ensure the platform's independence from
centralized servers by 2027, fostering privacy, freedom of movement, and
communication. The team's goal is to complete this migration 
without disrupting the user experience, ultimately making their
ongoing involvement unnecessary.

### Yana

[Yana](https://yana.do/) is a nostr client built on top of Dart NDK. It offers a
fast, multi-platform experience, particularly optimized for older devices. It
includes integrations with external apps for secure event signing, ensuring
users retain control over their private keys.

### Dart NDK

The author of Yana is also developing and maintaining [Dart
NDK](https://github.com/relaystr/dart_ndk), a nostr development kit written in
Dart which is designed to enhance the decentralization of nostr by providing
components for relay connectivity, caching, and high performance through native
implementations of performance-critical components in C and Rust. It supports
the [outbox model](https://github.com/frnandu/yana/blob/master/GOSSIP.md) for
improved data discovery without reliance on central coordination.

### Jester

[Jester](https://jesterui.github.io/) is a chess implementation that uses nostr
to communicate the player's moves. It is similar to
[Lichess](https://lichess.org/), but integrates bitcoin microtransactions and
thus allows players to earn sats and zap others during chess games. This project
aspires to engage the growing chess community, with plans for hosting
tournaments and potentially attracting broader audiences to nostr and Bitcoin.

### Nostr Spring Boot Starter

The [Nostr Spring Boot
Starter](https://github.com/theborakompanioni/nostr-spring-boot-starter) project
provides core modules for developing extensible relay and client software
tailored for businesses, focusing on Java and JVM-based languages. It aims to
serve as a foundational infrastructure similar to `nginx` for the web, but
specifically for nostr, catering to businesses and developers who may not have
the resources to build such infrastructure from the ground up.
