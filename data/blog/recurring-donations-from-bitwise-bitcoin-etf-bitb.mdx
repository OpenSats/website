OpenSats’ mission is to support and maintain a sustainable ecosystem of funding
for free and open-source projects and contributors, especially bitcoin-related
projects and projects that help bitcoin flourish. One of the most important
words in our mission statement is _sustainable_, which is why we are delighted to
report that Bitwise has committed to donating a considerable part of their
Bitcoin ETF's profits to OpenSats for the next 10 years.

As announced today, Bitwise will donate 10% of Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (ticker:
BITB) profits to bitcoin open-source development. OpenSats is one of the
recipients of this generous donation, along with Brink and the Human Rights
Foundation’s Bitcoin Development Fund.

We hope that, eventually, every Bitcoin ETF will follow the example of Bitwise,
giving back to the open-source community that tirelessly works on improving the
[infrastructure] we all depend upon.

Open-source software in general, and bitcoin in particular, is a positive-sum
game. We all benefit from the adoption of software that is open and free as in
freedom. With the growth in bitcoin adoption and appreciation, it will become
increasingly obvious that using a sound, global, borderless, and programmable
monetary protocol with an incorruptible monetary policy is beneficial for
everyone who chooses to opt in.

We applaud Bitwise for setting an example amongst Bitcoin ETF issuers and
encourage all other fund issuers to give back to the open-source ecosystem in a
similar way. If you are interested in supporting our mission please reach out to
us or [donate to OpenSats][donate] directly.
