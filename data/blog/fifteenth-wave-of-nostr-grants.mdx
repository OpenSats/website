We're pleased to announce our latest wave of grants from [The Nostr
Fund](/funds/nostr), supporting three open-source projects advancing the nostr
ecosystem.

This wave provides funding for work on agentic AI tooling, decentralized video
infrastructure, and community-run internet access, all built to utilize nostr
for identity, discovery, and communication.

The first-time grants highlighted in this wave are:

- [ContextVM](#contextvm)
- [Nostube](#nostube)
- [TollGate](#tollgate)

These grants are made possible by our generous donors who, like us, believe in
an open, censorship-resistant communications layer for the internet.

Our nostr grants are sourced from The Nostr Fund. To help us support the nostr
ecosystem, please consider making a donation.

In the sections below, we will describe how each project is contributing to the
future of nostr.

### ContextVM

[ContextVM] is a protocol built on [MCP] that enables servers and clients to
communicate over nostr. MCP is a standard that lets AI models connect to
external tools and data sources. Nostr is an open communication network built on
cryptographic, permissionless foundations. By combining the two, ContextVM
removes the need for domains, [OAuth], and port forwarding. Each service is
identified by a public key and operates from any device with only an outbound
internet connection. Nostr handles identity, authentication, discovery, and
transport. The project grew out of the earlier [DVMCP] effort and now publishes
a JavaScript/TypeScript software development kit ([SDK]), a [documentation
site], and reference tooling for [relays] and [gateways]. The [SovEng 5 cohort]
demonstrated the protocol's practical utility, with multiple new projects built
directly on top of it.

This grant will support core protocol development, expand the SDK, and improve
the reliability of shared infrastructure such as public relays. The team plans
to build payment handling directly into the protocol, designed so that server
operators can accept multiple payment methods, including Lightning and Cashu. A
marketplace model will let servers that offer similar capabilities be discovered
and used together, similar to the [original DVM proposal]. Additional goals
include new SDK implementations in Go and Rust, one-click deployment packages
for platforms like Umbrel and Start9, comprehensive documentation and tutorials,
and integration with open-source developer tools such as [Roo Code], [goose],
and [OpenCode] to place nostr-routed MCP services directly inside developer
workflows.

### Nostube

[Nostube] is a platform developed to bring long-form and short-form video to the
nostr protocol. The web application supports uploads, playlists, subscriptions,
comments, and user profiles in both landscape and portrait video formats. It is
built with [React], [Vite], [TailwindCSS], [shadcn/ui], and the [Applesauce]
development stack, connecting to nostr relays for identity, feeds, and social
interactions.

This grant will support the infrastructure needed to make decentralized video on
nostr practical at scale. The roadmap covers uploads of multi-gigabyte files to
dedicated [Blossom servers], paid storage with mirroring across multiple
servers, and thumbnail generation. Video transcoding will be distributed across
workers who are paid in Cashu to convert videos into streamable formats. Planned
features include subtitles, HLS playback, playlists, [zaps], and improved
profile integration. A Web of Trust model will allow users to rehost videos and
contribute transcoded versions, improving content availability while limiting
abuse. Development will include ongoing collaboration with other video-related
nostr projects such as [zap.stream], [Primal], and Blossom.

### TollGate

[TollGate] is a software project for turning WiFi routers into bitcoin-powered,
pay-as-you-go internet access points. The software gives operators a
permissionless way to resell their connection, where users pay in [ecash] in
small increments for connectivity. The system runs on [OpenWrt-compatible]
routers and uses nostr-based modules that work together. The merchant module
sets prices and processes payments, the valve module controls who can access the
internet, and the [Crows Nest] module scans for available gateways and connects
to them. Routers running TollGate can also purchase access from other TollGate
routers, which extends the network outward from a single upstream connection.
The project already provides a published [protocol specification], a working
implementation for OpenWrt routers, a pre-built [TollGateOS] firmware, and an
[installer] with a guided setup process for supported hardware.

This grant supports continued work on router software, developer experience, and
adoption. The team plans to simplify builds and installation flows on OpenWrt
routers and to support the development of mobile Crows Nest clients that
discover nearby gateways and handle payments on behalf of users. Companion
software will target common desktop and ARM devices and help those devices act
as TollGate clients. A streamlined setup path will simplify turning a compatible
router into a full TollGate gateway. The project also plans to collaborate with
mesh and community network groups such as [Guifi], [Freifunk], and [Funkfeuer].
Packages are slated for distribution through [Zapstore](https://zapstore.dev/)
and OpenWrt package lists, and TollGate gateways are intended to be found
through nostr-based discovery and mapping tools such as [OpenStreetMap]. Further
work includes exploration of cellular and neutral host integrations, with the
goal of placing TollGate modules inside privacy-focused operating systems and
open access network stacks.

The projects in this wave reflect the broadening scope of what developers are
choosing to build on nostr. From AI tooling and video infrastructure to
community networking, each grant supports software that uses nostr's identity
and transport layer to solve real challenges. We look forward to seeing these
projects make an impact and are grateful to our donors for making this support
possible.

To help us continue supporting the nostr ecosystem, please consider setting up a
recurring donation to The Nostr Fund. Any amount helps.
