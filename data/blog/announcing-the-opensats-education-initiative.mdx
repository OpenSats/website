We are excited to announce the launch of the OpenSats Education Initiative, an
exciting new chapter in our mission to promote and support Bitcoin education and
outreach worldwide. As part of our commitment to fostering knowledge and
understanding of Bitcoin, starting today we are accepting grant applications
specifically focused on Bitcoin educational projects.

The initiative will be led by [Dread](/about/dread), in cooperation with veteran
Bitcoin educators that form our education sub-committee. We want to ensure that
funding reaches the audiences that need Bitcoin education the most, fostering a
deeper understanding of Bitcoin across diverse audiences.

## A Renewed Focus on Education

As education has always been at the heart of [our mission](/mission) at
OpenSats, we have previously funded education projects focused on Bitcoin. By
formally introducing the Education Initiative, we aim to highlight our
dedication to supporting educational endeavors within the Bitcoin community.

This initiative ensures that individuals and organizations can apply for grants
with an explicit focus on creating and disseminating educational content at all
levels related to Bitcoin, from beginner-level awareness and outreach projects
to advanced technical developer education programs.

## Open Source and Open License

A core principle of OpenSats is that all supported projects [must be
open-source](/selection) and freely accessible. Consequently, all educational
materials funded through our grants must be published under a free and open
license, making them available to everyone.

We believe that the power of education lies in its open accessibility, and this
initiative is designed to break down paywalls and other financial barriers,
providing free high-quality educational resources to anyone interested in
learning about Bitcoin.

## New Grant Announcements

As part of this initiative launch, our board has selected three more projects
for funding. In no particular order, here they are:

- [Satoshi Nakamoto Institute](#satoshi-nakamoto-institute)
- [Mi Primer Bitcoin](#mi-primer-bitcoin)
- [Summer of Bitcoin](#summer-of-bitcoin)

These projects represent a wide range of educational approaches, from in-depth
historical analysis to hands-on learning experiences, and we are proud to
support their efforts to spread Bitcoin knowledge.

### Satoshi Nakamoto Institute

The Satoshi Nakamoto Institute works to advance and preserve knowledge of
Bitcoin’s history, economics, and technology. The Institute hosts an archive of
Satoshi’s public writings, and a vast library of works relevant to understanding
Bitcoin in its full historical, economic, and political context.

### Summer of Bitcoin

Summer of Bitcoin is a global, online summer internship program focused on
introducing university students to Bitcoin open-source development and design.
Students contribute code or design for Bitcoin open-source projects, earn sats
as a stipend, and put their summer break to good use. The project communities
provide mentors who guide students through the entire summer, helping students
learn about the project & community and contribute code or design.
