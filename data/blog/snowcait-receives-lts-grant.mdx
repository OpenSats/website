OpenSats is excited to announce long-term support for
[SnowCait](https://github.com/SnowCait), a dedicated contributor to the nostr
ecosystem. Through open-source development and active community engagement, they
continue to improve the protocol's usability, reliability, and accessibility for
users, and developers.

SnowCait is the creator of [nostter](https://nostter.app/), a web-based client,
and [Snowflare](https://github.com/SnowCait/snowflare), a serverless relay
designed to simplify deployment and reduce overhead. Other contributions include
[nostr playground](https://github.com/SnowCait/nostr-playground), a JSON-based
client for testing and debugging;
[snow-actions/nostr](https://github.com/snow-actions/nostr), a GitHub Actions
integration for automated event broadcasting; and tools like
[Restr](https://github.com/SnowCait/restr), [nostr
hours](https://github.com/SnowCait/nostr-hours), and various bots that assist
with user discovery, content search, and bitcoin price tracking.

These efforts have helped grow the ecosystem by making it more approachable,
interoperable, and efficient—lowering the barrier to participation across
roles and use cases.

Long-term support will allow SnowCait to maintain core projects while launching
major upgrades and new features. Planned work includes:

- **Releasing nostter v2** with embedded notes,
  [NIP-47](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/47.md) Nostr
  Wallet Connect integration, a deck-style UI, real-time push notifications, and
  performance optimizations.
- **Expanding Snowflare** support for
  [NIP-40](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/40.md),
  [NIP-45](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/45.md), and
  [NIP-62](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/62.md), along with
  logging, analytics, and an improved admin portal.
- **Exploring support** for
  [NIP-50](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/50.md) and
  prototyping new tools such as offline authentication, a serverless
  [NIP-46](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/46.md) remote
  signer, and a
  [NIP-96](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/96.md) media
  uploader.

SnowCait's vision is to support diverse user needs through flexible, low-cost
software while continuing to build an open infrastructure that strengthens the
connection between nostr and the broader Bitcoin ecosystem.

> I would like to continue to enrich the Nostr ecosystem and increase the
