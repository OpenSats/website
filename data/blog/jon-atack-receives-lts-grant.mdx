OpenSats proudly announces long-term support for [Jon
Atack](https://jonatack.github.io/), a dedicated contributor to Bitcoin Core and
the Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs).

Since 2019, Jon has been pivotal in strengthening [Bitcoin
Core](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) through general code review and ongoing
maintenance. As a [BIPs](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips#) editor and
maintainer, Jon plans to help ensure critical proposals, such as soft forks, are
carefully reviewed to uphold the integrity of Bitcoin's consensus rules and
security.

This grant allows Jon to resume full-time contributions, focusing on:

- Conducting in-depth reviews of Bitcoin Core changes and BIP proposals to
  safeguard decentralization, security and robustness.

- Mentoring developers and guiding complex changes in Bitcoin's codebase.

Jon is also receiving a long-term grant from [Maelstrom's Bitcoin Grant
Program](https://maelstrom.fund/bitcoin-grant-program/), allowing him to
further focus on his vital work in Bitcoin development. Beyond the technical
aspects, Jon hopes to pursue a long-term, evergreen role of help and service,
ideally with a measure of kindness, wisdom and forbearance.

>I'm concerned about decentralization, privacy, freedom and self-sovereignty.
>Against a backdrop of increasing dystopia, control, censorship, surveillance,
>conflict and oppression, Bitcoin is fundamental. It needs continued vigilance,
>review, maintenance, and improved decentralization, robustness, privacy and
>user experience.
