OpenSats proudly announces long-term support for [Jon
Atack](https://jonatack.github.io/), a dedicated contributor to Bitcoin Core and
the Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs).

Since 2019, Jon has been pivotal in strengthening [Bitcoin
Core](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) through general code review and ongoing
maintenance. As a [BIPs](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips#) editor and
maintainer, Jon helps ensure critical proposals, such as soft forks, are
carefully reviewed to uphold the integrity of Bitcoin's consensus rules and
security.

This grant allows Jon to resume full-time contributions, focusing on:

- Conducting in-depth reviews of Bitcoin Core changes and BIP proposals to
  safeguard security and robustness.

- Mentoring developers and guiding complex changes in Bitcoin's codebase.

Jon is also receiving grants from [Maelstrom's Bitcoin Grant
Program](https://maelstrom.fund/bitcoin-grant-program/), and [The Human Rights
Foundation's Bitcoin Development Fund](https://hrf.org/devfund), allowing him to
further focus on his vital work in Bitcoin development. Beyond the technical
aspects, Jon hopes to pursue a long-term, evergreen role of help and service,
with a measure of kindness, wisdom and forbearance.

>My aim is to help improve Bitcoin for everyone, make it safer, easier to use,
>and scale into the future.
