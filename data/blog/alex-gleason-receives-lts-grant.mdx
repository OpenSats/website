OpenSats is pleased to announce long-term support for [Alex
Gleason](https://github.com/alexgleason), a prominent contributor to the nostr
ecosystem.

Alex is most recently known for launching [Ditto](https://soapbox.pub/ditto/), a
decentralized, self-hosted social media server that prioritizes user control and
community building, featuring a built-in nostr client and relay, compatible with
Mastodon apps. He presented [Ditto at the Nostriga
conference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZyqVGHjDGo) in August 2024.

Beyond Ditto, Alex has made substantial contributions through several other key
projects, including the [Mostr
Bridge](https://soapbox.pub/blog/mostr-fediverse-nostr-bridge/), which connects
nostr with the [fediverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse);
[Soapbox](https://docs.soapbox.pub/soapbox/), an open-source, customizable, and
self-hostable front-end for decentralized social networks;
[Nostrify](https://gitlab.com/soapbox-pub/nostrify/-/blob/main/README.md), a
nostr framework for web browsers and [Deno](https://docs.deno.com/); and
[Letr](https://www.letr.co/), a dynamic creator platform built on nostr for sharing 
diverse content, prioritizing creator compensation.

With the support of this grant, Alex plans to:

- **Introduce new features** such as purchasing
  [NIP-05](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/05.md) usernames
  with [Zaps](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/57.md), a
  digital shop for profile customization, and improved support for [Mastodon
  apps](https://joinmastodon.org/apps).

- **Grow the community** by migrating existing Soapbox servers, onboarding various
  nostr communities, and launching initiatives like
  [Henhouse.social](https://henhouse.social/)â€”a nostr community for women.

- **Refine and expand Ditto** with bug fixes, UX enhancements, as well as
  performance and stability improvements.

Our mission at OpenSats is to provide sustainable funding for the builders and
maintainers of critical open-source infrastructure within the Bitcoin and nostr
ecosystem.

Our [LTS program](/blog/nostr-lts-long-term-support-for-nostr-developers) is
made possible by generous donors like you. To continue supporting important
contributors like Alex, consider donating to [The Nostr Fund](/funds/nostr).
