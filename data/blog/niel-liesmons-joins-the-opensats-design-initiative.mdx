summary: "The Nostr Design initiative grows and has its first results to show."
---

A couple of weeks ago, we announced the Nostr Design initiative, which aims to
help "[take nostr mainstream][ms]," to quote our furry friend with purple-colored
glasses. As Karnage wrote in last month's post, he and Daniele are leading the
charge of making the user-facing side of nostr better, prettier, more intuitive,
and more accessible. And since all good things come in threes, we're pleased to
announce a new addition to the OpenSats design team: [Niel Liesmons][niel].

Niel is an Industrial Designer who is now bringing his years of making beautiful
and convincing presentations for his designs to the world of nostr UI & UX.

In addition to welcoming Neil, we want to take a minute to reflect on where
we've been, where we are now, and where we might go in the future. Not in terms
of the nitty-gritty of the nostr protocol, but in terms of the user-facing side
of things.

Undoubtedly, nostr clients have come a long way. The days of incredibly clunky
and buggy clients are mostly behind us, and, luckily, you don't need to be a
command-line wizard anymore to interface with the protocol. We have native
mobile clients, web clients, progressive web apps, and more. Most of them are
pretty useable, and, dare I say it, some of them are even pretty.

Yes, the user experience of most nostr clients still has long ways to go.
However, it's useful to remind ourselves of where we've been just 18 months ago.
The best-in-class nostr clients looked something like this:

Okay, okay. I exaggerate. But not by much! Some nostr OGs will look at this
screenshot with a smile that only nostalgia can produce. All great things have
humble beginnings, and nostr is no exception.  Most great things adapt, evolve,
and improve over time. And nostr is no exception in that regard either.

As more developers and designers join the flock of nostriches that cares about a
social web that is free as in speech, the UX of nostr clients is bound to
improve. We hope that a resource like Nostr Design as well as active client
reviews such as the one below will help along the way.

We've got great feedback—from developers and designers alike—for the Nostr
Design resource that was put together over the course of the last months.
Karnage, Daniele, and Niel will continually improve NostrDesign.org, so please
keep your feedback coming!

And if it was useful to you, please let us know too! Here's some success stories of Nostr Design so far:

- [Lume](https://lume.nu/) improved their onboarding based on our feedback
- [0xchat](https://github.com/0xchat-app) made various UI improvements
- [noStrudel](https://nostrudel.ninja/) is implementing recommendations
- [Spring](https://spring.site/) in its current shape is based on NostrDesign recommendations

Thoughts? Suggestions? Feedback? Let's hear it all. Reach out to us on nostr or
write us at design@opensats.org
