summary: "The Nostr Design initiative grows and has its first results to show."
---

A couple of weeks ago, we announced the Nostr Design initiative, which aims to
help "[take nostr mainstream][ms]," to quote our furry friend with purple-colored
glasses. As Karnage wrote in last month's post, he and Daniele are leading the
charge of making the user-facing side of nostr better, prettier, more intuitive,
and more accessible. And since all good things come in threes, we're pleased to
announce a new addition to the OpenSats design team: [Niel Liesmons][niel].

Niel is an Industrial Designer who is now bringing his years of making beautiful
and convincing presentations for his designs to the world of nostr UI & UX. He
will help make [NostrDesign.org][nd] and the clients that implement its best practices
better and more beautiful, which is another way of saying easier to understand
and use.

In addition to welcoming Niel, we want to take a minute to reflect on where
we've been, where we are now, and where we might go in the future. Not in terms
of the nitty-gritty of the nostr protocol, but in terms of the user-facing side
of things.

Undoubtedly, nostr clients have come a long way. The days of incredibly clunky
and buggy clients are mostly behind us, and, luckily, you don't need to be a
command-line wizard anymore to interface with the protocol. We have native
mobile clients, web clients, progressive web apps, and more. Most of them are
pretty useable, and, dare I say it, some of them are even pretty.

Yes, the user experience of most nostr clients still has long ways to go.
However, it's useful to remind ourselves of where we've been just 18 months ago.
The best-in-class nostr clients looked something like this:

Okay, okay. I exaggerate. But not by much! Some nostr OGs will look at this
screenshot with a smile that only nostalgia can produce. All great things have
humble beginnings, and nostr is no exception.  Most great things adapt, evolve,
and improve over time. And nostr is no exception in that regard either.

As more developers and designers join the flock of nostriches that cares about a
social web that is free as in speech, the UX of nostr clients is bound to
improve. We hope that a resource like Nostr Design as well as active client
reviews such as the one below will help along the way.

We've got great feedback—from developers and designers alike—for the Nostr
Design resource that was put together over the course of the last few months.
Karnage, Daniele, and Niel will continually improve [NostrDesign.org][nd], so
please keep your feedback coming!

Here's some success stories that developers have shared with us:

- [Lume](https://lume.nu/) improved their onboarding based on our feedback
- [0xchat](https://github.com/0xchat-app) made various UI improvements
- [noStrudel](https://nostrudel.ninja/) is implementing recommendations
- [Spring](https://spring.site/) in its current shape is based on NostrDesign recommendations

The short list above is far from exhaustive. A lot of the work is currently
ongoing and in early stages.

If the work we are doing was useful to you, please let us know! Reach out to us
on nostr or write us at design@opensats.org. We're happy to hear any and all
thoughts, suggestions, ideas for improvement, as well as have lively discussions on how to best
design the strange and beautiful experience that is nostr.

We have great plans for [our design initiative](/nostr/#nostr-design) and can't
wait to see all the amazing stuff that is going to be built. Onwards!
