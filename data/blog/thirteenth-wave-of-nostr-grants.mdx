summary: "OpenSats is funding nine more open-source projects advancing the nostr ecosystem."
---

We are pleased to announce the latest wave of grants from The Nostr Fund, dedicated 
to advancing the nostr ecosystem by supporting builders working to make nostr more 
accessible, secure, and resilient.

In this wave, we highlight four projects that span creator tools, community
infrastructure, archival systems, and distributed collaboration. Five additional
projects outlined below have received renewal grants to continue their work.
Supporting these projects reflects our belief that resilient open-source
software is a public good. Once built, it can be reused, adapted, and scaled by
the community.

First-time project grants:

- [ZapTracker](#zaptracker)
- [Keydex](#keydex)
- [Bigbrotr](#bigbrotr)
- [Grasp](#grasp)

Grant renewals:

- Jumble.Social ([Jun. 2025])
- Nostr Safebox ([Dec. 2024])
- Coop ([Nov. 2024])
- 0xchat ([Oct. 2023])
- Damus ([Jul. 2023])

This support is made possible by the generosity of donors who believe in an open, 
censorship-resistant communications layer for the internet, and by the builders 
turning that vision into reality.

To help strengthen the nostr ecosystem, please consider donating to The Nostr Fund.

### ZapTracker

[ZapTracker] is an open-source dashboard for Lightning and nostr creators that
brings together zap analytics, wallet management via [Nostr Wallet Connect],
audience interaction, and content publishing in a single, privacy-first frontend
application. It tracks earnings and supporters in real time, including chat and
long-form posts, and stores data locally to avoid reliance on servers or
third-party data collection.

With support from this grant, ZapTracker plans to ship ZapGoals with [NIP-75]
support, a calendar and RSVP for events with [NIP-52], scheduled notes and
long-form publishing, monetized private content, audience-building follow lists,
improving messaging security, and a UX redesign based on user feedback.

### Keydex

Keydex is an open-source backup and recovery tool for sensitive data, including
passwords, digital wills, and cryptographic keys. Instead of storing full copies
in one place, Keydex uses [Shamir’s Secret Sharing] to split a secret into
pieces and distribute them to friends and family; recovery happens only when
enough participants consent to reassemble the secret. The app is built with
[Flutter] for cross-platform delivery and is currently in the alpha stage of
development.

Support from this grant will advance Keydex from an alpha prototype toward a
dependable release by improving the secret-sharing and recovery flows, the
consent and coordination UX, and expanding cross-platform packaging and
distribution. Funds will also support testing, documentation, and security
review work required for a tool that handles high-stakes data.

capabilities including group wallets, code reviews, voice chat, and event RSVPs.

### Bigbrotr

[Bigbrotr] is a modular, open-source infrastructure for archiving and monitoring
the nostr network. It enables structured analysis of public events and relay
activity across Clearnet and Tor, offering a transparent view of network
behavior and health. Built as containerized services with [PostgreSQL] for data
management, it includes a synchronizer for event indexing, a monitor for relay
responsiveness and metadata including [NIP-11] and [NIP-66], and a finder for
discovering new relays. Designed for research and interoperability, Bigbrotr's
Docker-based setup makes it simple to deploy and extend, serving as a versatile
backend for clients, researchers, and relay operators with APIs, dashboards, and
a [Data Vending Machine] integration for specialized data queries.

With support from this grant, the project will deploy Bigbrotr on self-hosted
hardware, optimize synchronization and monitoring, and release Lilbrotr, a
lightweight version for indexing on low-resource devices. The roadmap includes
finalizing Lilbrotr and documentation, publishing public APIs, and refining
security and performance ahead of dashboard releases and community feedback
cycles. These improvements will strengthen Bigbrotr's role as a foundation for
advanced analytics, smarter relay selection, and reusable backend tools across
the nostr ecosystem.

### Grasp

[Grasp] is a distributed, nostr-native alternative to centralized git hosting
platforms. Developed by returning grantee [Dan
Conway,](/blog/nostr-grants-july-2023#code-collaboration-over-nostr) who
previously created a git-over-nostr proof of concept, the Grasp project extends
that work by applying nostr’s event-based authorization and relay architecture
to version control. Built around [NIP-34], it allows repository actions such as
pushes and state updates to be authorized and verified directly through signed
nostr events, removing the need for centralized intermediaries.

With support from this grant, Grasp will deliver libraries and tooling for nostr
clients to interact with git data and pull requests, a high-performance git
plugin, and synchronization tools that maintain reliability across distributed
relays. The project will also define a clear specification and collaborate with
other developers to build an open ecosystem of nostr-based git infrastructure,
positioning Grasp as a decentralized, verifiable alternative to existing
code-hosting platforms.

The projects in this wave are examples of the kind of foundational work that
turns protocols into growing ecosystems. By funding tools for creators,
communities, infrastructure, and distributed collaboration, OpenSats is doing
its part to support the underlying strength of nostr's long-term viability.

We are grateful to our donors for making these grants possible and to the
developers advancing open-source technology.
