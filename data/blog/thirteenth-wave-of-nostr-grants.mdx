summary: "OpenSats is funding nine more open-source projects advancing the nostr ecosystem."
---

We are pleased to announce the latest wave of grants dedicated to advancing the
nostr ecosystem. OpenSats' mission is to support open-source projects that make
nostr more accessible, secure, decentralized, and easy to use.

In this wave, we highlight four projects that span creator tools, community
infrastructure, archival systems, and distributed collaboration. Five additional
projects outlined below have received renewal grants to continue their work.
Supporting these projects reflects our belief that resilient open-source
software is a public good. Once built, it can be reused, adapted, and scaled by
the community.

First-time project grants:

- [ZapTracker](#zaptracker)
- [Plural and Social Key Recovery](#plural-and-social-key-recovery)
- [Bigbrotr](#bigbrotr)
- [Grasp](#grasp)

Grant renewals:

- Jumble.Social ([06-2025])
- Nostr Safebox ([12-2024])
- Coop ([11-2024])
- 0xchat ([10-2023])
- Damus ([07-2023])

This support is made possible by donors who believe in an open,
censorship-resistant communications layer for the internet, and by the builders
making that a reality.

Nostr grants are sourced from The Nostr Fund. To help us support the nostr
ecosystem, please consider making a donation.

### ZapTracker

[ZapTracker] is an open-source dashboard for Lightning and nostr creators that
brings together zap analytics, wallet management via [Nostr Wallet Connect],
audience interaction, and content publishing in a single, privacy-first frontend
application. It tracks earnings and supporters in real time, including chat and
long-form posts, and stores data locally to avoid reliance on servers or
third-party data collection.

With support from this grant, ZapTracker plans to ship ZapGoals with [NIP-75]
support, a calendar and RSVP for events with [NIP-52], scheduled notes and
long-form publishing, monetized private content, audience-building follow lists,
improving messaging security, and a UX redesign based on user feedback.

### Plural and Social Key Recovery

Plural and Social Key Recovery is a nostr-native communities app focused on
private, reliable group communication. It aims to replace fragmented tools like
Telegram and GitHub by delivering topic-based conversations, privacy-preserving
batched notifications, invitation links that work across platforms, and admin
features for communities. The app targets [NIP-29] relay-based communities and
will be built with [Flutter] for cross-platform performance and a clean UX.

Support from this grant will fund development towards an alpha release for iOS
and Android with group creation and conversation, followed by a beta with push
notifications, privacy-aware summaries, invitation links, and a desktop or web
build. A 1.0 release will deliver refined features to the Apple and Google
stores. Subsequent milestones will add decision-making tools such as polls,
ranked-choice voting, and consent-based rounds, which could enable future
capabilities including group wallets, code reviews, voice chat, and event RSVPs.

### Bigbrotr

[Bigbrotr] is a modular, open-source infrastructure for archiving and monitoring
the nostr network. It enables structured analysis of public events and relay
activity across Clearnet and Tor, offering a transparent view of network
behavior and health. Built as containerized services with [PostgreSQL] for data
management, it includes a synchronizer for event indexing, a monitor for relay
responsiveness and metadata including [NIP-11] and [NIP-66], and a finder for
discovering new relays. Designed for research and interoperability, Bigbrotr's
Docker-based setup makes it simple to deploy and extend, serving as a versatile
backend for clients, researchers, and relay operators with APIs, dashboards, and
a [Data Vending Machine] integration for specialized data queries.

With support from this grant, the project will deploy Bigbrotr on self-hosted
hardware, optimize synchronization and monitoring, and release Lilbrotr, a
lightweight version for indexing on low-resource devices. The roadmap includes
finalizing Lilbrotr and documentation, publishing public APIs, and refining
security and performance ahead of dashboard releases and community feedback
cycles. These improvements will strengthen Bigbrotr's role as a foundation for
advanced analytics, smarter relay selection, and reusable backend tools across
the nostr ecosystem.

### Grasp

[Grasp] is a distributed, nostr-native alternative to centralized Git hosting
platforms. Developed by returning grantee [Dan
Conway,](/blog/nostr-grants-july-2023#code-collaboration-over-nostr) who
initially worked on a Git-over-nostr proof of concept, the Grasp project extends
that work by bringing the collaborative model of [Blossom] to software
development. It applies nostr's decentralized principles to version control.
Built around [NIP-34], it allows repositories, commits, and merges to be
authorized and verified directly through nostr events.

With support from this grant, Grasp will deliver a library for nostr clients to
interact with Git data and pull requests, a high-performance Git plugin, and
synchronization tools to maintain reliability across distributed environments.
The project will also define a clear specification and collaborate with other
developers to grow an open ecosystem of nostr-based Git tools, positioning Grasp
as a decentralized alternative to existing code-hosting platforms.

The projects in this wave are examples of the kind of foundational work that
turns protocols into growing ecosystems. By funding tools for creators,
communities, infrastructure, and distributed collaboration, OpenSats is doing
its part to support the underlying strength of nostr's long-term viability.

We are grateful to our donors who make these grants possible and to the
developers building open-source technology.
