summary: "OpenSats is funding over a dozen open-source projects in the bitcoin ecosystem."
---

In addition to offering [long-term support for core
devs](https://opensats.org/blog/announcing-lts-grant-program-to-support-bitcoin-core-contributors)
and similar bitcoin infrastructure engineers, we aim to support a multitude of
open-source projects that are aligned with our mission.

We are delighted to announce grants for over a dozen projects in the bitcoin &
lightning ecosystem. The following open-source projects were selected by the
OpenSats board according to our [grant selection
process](https://github.com/OpenSats/website/blob/master/docs/grant-selection.md):

- [Payjoin Dev Kit](https://github.com/payjoin)
- [Bolt12 for LND](https://github.com/ziggie1984)
- [Splicing](https://lightningsplice.com/)
- [Raspiblitz](https://github.com/raspiblitz/raspiblitz)
- [Labelbase](https://github.com/Labelbase/Labelbase)
- [BTCPay Server](https://github.com/btcpayserver)
- [ZeroSync](https://github.com/zerosync/zerosync)
- [Mutiny Wallet](https://github.com/MutinyWallet)
- [next-auth Lightning Provider](https://github.com/jowo-io/next-auth-lightning-provider)
- [Cashu](https://github.com/cashubtc/cashu)
- [lnproxy](https://github.com/lnproxy/lnproxy)
- [Blixt Wallet](https://github.com/hsjoberg/blixt-wallet)

In addition to the open-source projects listed above, we funded three
educational efforts: [Bitcoin Education in
Nigeria](https://geyser.fund/project/bitcoineducationinnigeriawithapatajohnson),
21 Ideas, and one of the upcoming CoreDev Events.

The first is an initiative started and led by Apata Johnson. Apata's project
aims to educate youths on bitcoin and the opportunities it brings for the people
living in the rural areas of Nigeria.

The second, [21 Ideas](https://www.21ideas.org/), is a project that aims to
bring quality Bitcoin education to Russian citizens. Tony and others have been
working for many years on translations, original material, and hands-on
tutorials for beginners. We believe that education is paramount to proper
Bitcoin use, and localization is paramount for everyday citizens to properly
grasp the importance as well as the novel concepts of bitcoin.

Last but not least, we provide financial support for one of the upcoming
[CoreDev](https://coredev.tech/) developer events, which is all about bringing
developers together so that they can hack on Bitcoin Core and related software.

Now let's take a closer look at the projects to better understand what the
purpose and goal of each is.

### Payjoin Dev Kit

Payjoin brings privacy to bitcoin without changing the way you're used to using
it. Payjoin transactions look no different from normal activity on-chain, so
they boost everyone's privacy, even those who don't payjoin, and foil chain
surveillance.

Payjoin is easy to integrate and falls back to working defaults where it isn't
supported, but it can only take off when senders and receivers include standard
payjoin support in their software. Payjoin Dev Kit makes it easy to integrate
BIP 78 standard payjoin everywhere, having working reference integrations for
Bitcoin Core, LND, and BDK.

### Bolt12 for LND

Bolt12 brings a new invoice format, enabling static invoices (offers) as well as
recurring payments. It adds support to receive payments in a lightning-native
way without using a web server. It also uses Blinded Paths to disguise the
destination of a node both when fetching the invoice and when paying. This
improves privacy and, therefore, security for the receiver of the payment.

Consequently, Bolt12 makes it much easier to receive and send payments without
any third-party infrastructure in a native-lightning way. Static invoices make
donations and recurring payments much easier.

### Splicing

Splicing is the ability to resize Lightning channels on-the-fly, giving users of
the Lightning Network many additional benefits that were not intuitively obvious
at first. Splicing scales Lightning by removing a fundamental limitation.
Removing this limitation increases fungibility and lowers blockspace usage, an
important step towards maturing the Lightning network and enabling the
onboarding of millions, and ultimately billions, of people.

### Raspiblitz

Raspiblitz is a do-it-yourself node stack that allows you to run a Lightning
Node together with a Bitcoin Core full node on your Raspberry Pi. While the
Raspberry Pi is the most common hardware running this particular software, it
was developed to support multiple hardware platforms and can run on bare metal
servers too.

The open-source project was started in 2018 as part of a Lightning hackathon in
the German Bitcoin space. Since then, it has grown to over 150 contributors and
2000 stars on GitHub. The software integrates dozens of services and tools via
its plugin system and sports advanced features like touchscreen support, channel
autopilot, backup systems, DynDNS, SSH tunneling, and more.

### Labelbase

Labelbase is a label management service for Bitcoin transactions and addresses.
It provides features for adding labels, importing and exporting labels, and
offers a public API for integration with wallets and existing workflows.

Labelbase supports
[BIP-329](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0329.mediawiki), a
format for unifying label data. The goal of the project is to offer a convenient
solution for managing labels associated with Bitcoin transactions and addresses
across wallets and other tools. By providing a unified label management
interface, Labelbase enhances the user experience, improves privacy, and
promotes better organization and understanding of Bitcoin transactions.

### BTCPay Server

BTCPay Server is a free, open-source & self-hosted bitcoin payment gateway that
allows self-sovereign individuals and businesses to accept bitcoin payments
online or in person without added fees.

At its core, BTCPay Server is an automated invoicing system. Merchants can
integrate the software with their website or shop, so customers are presented
with an invoice upon checkout. The status of the invoice will update according
to settlement, so merchants can fulfill the order at the appropriate time. The
software also takes care of payment refunding and bitcoin management alongside
many other features.

### ZeroSync

While ZeroSync is still at an early stage, its promise is to allow verification
of Bitcoin's chain state in an instant. It offers compact cryptographic proofs
to validate the entire history of transactions and everyone's current balances.

The first application is to "zerosync" Bitcoin Core in pruned mode. The
long-term vision for ZeroSync is to become a toolbox for custom Bitcoin proofs.

### Mutiny Wallet

Mutiny Wallet is a web-first wallet capable of running anywhere, providing
instant onboarding and platform censorship resistance. It is self-custodial,
privacy-focused, user-friendly, and open-sourced under the MIT license.

The wallet has a strong focus on privacy, scalability, and accessibility. In
addition to features that you would expect a regular lightning wallet to have,
the team is working to incorporate Nostr-related features into the wallet, such
as a feed of friends' Zaps, native Zap sending and receiving, a lightning
subscription specification for services such as nostr relays, and a P2P DLC
marketplace. The team's goal is to provide users with a seamless experience,
combining the power of Bitcoin and Lightning with social media in a way that
matches the Bitcoin ethos.

### next-auth Lightning Provider

The goal of this project is to implement an authentication provider for
next-auth, an authentication provider for the popular open-source framework
NextJS. The next-auth framework has nearly 500k weekly downloads and powers the
authentication of many modern web, mobile, and desktop apps. Having a
plug-and-play Provider for Lightning makes integration easier and more
attractive for developers.

### Cashu

Cashu is a Chaumian ecash system built for bitcoin that brings near-perfect
privacy for users of custodial bitcoin applications. A Cashu ecash mint does not
know who you are, what your balance is, or who you're transacting with. Users of
a mint can exchange ecash privately, without anyone being able to know who the
involved parties are.

Payments are executed without anyone able to censor specific users. There are
multiple implementations of the Cashu protocol. Popular open-source wallets are
Cashu Nutshell, Cashu.me, and Nutstash.

### lnproxy

lnproxy is a simple privacy tool that empowers users of custodial Lightning
wallets with better payment destination privacy and sovereign node runners with
enhanced receiver privacy. lnproxy works like a "poor man's" rendezvous router,
providing privacy for users without taking custody of their funds. The project
encompasses an LNURL-style protocol specification and a collection of
open-source implementations of lnproxy clients and a relay.

### Blixt Wallet

Blixt is a non-custodial Lightning wallet for Android, iOS, and macOS with a
focus on usability and user experience. The project's current target audience is
bitcoiners who want to give Lightning a try.

Blixt uses LND and Neutrino under the hood, directly on the phone, respecting
your privacy. The wallet does not use any centralized servers for doing
transactions. Channels are opened automatically on the user's behalf, making it
easy to get up and running on Lightning.

We received a large number of applications in the last couple of months.
Unfortunately, we were unable to fund all of the proposals that were sent to us
last quarter. Please don't hesitate to apply again in case your application was
rejected this time around. The applicant pool was very competitive, which is a
great thing to see in and of itself.

Our team is screening applications constantly, and we will announce new grants
and funding opportunities quarterly or as they arise. If you are working on an
open-source project in and around bitcoin, and you think your work is aligned
with the OpenSats mission, please apply for funding on our website:
[opensats.org/apply](https://opensats.org/apply)

All of the projects above are funded by contributions to the Bitcoin General
Fund. Our grant programs are made possible by generous donors like you. If you
want to help fund the Bitcoin ecosystem, please [donate to the Bitcoin General
Fund](https://opensats.org/projects/general_fund).

"The computer can be used as a tool to liberate and protect people, rather than
to control them," as [Hal
Finney](https://cypherpunks.venona.com/date/1992/11/msg00108.html) wrote so
presciently 30 years ago. The goal of OpenSats is to help build the tools that
Hal alluded to. Tools that liberate and protect, rather than systems that
control and oppress. Many tools still have to be built. Many tools still need to
be improved. However, "the universe smiles on encryption," as Assange so aptly
put it. We believe that freedom tech is what carries this smile forward,
brightening our collective future while elevating the sovereignty of the
individual.
