OpenSats is pleased to announce that [Steak 'n
Shake](https://www.steaknshake.com/), a classic American burger chain accepting
bitcoin payments, has launched a [Bitcoin Meal
promotion](https://xcancel.com/SteaknShake/status/1984298263508324442) that will
provide ongoing support for open-source development.

Over the next 12 months, Steak 'n Shake will donate 210 sats from every Bitcoin
Meal it sells to OpenSats, turning everyday orders into direct support for
Bitcoin and freedom tech contributors.

Open Sats Initiative, Inc. is a 501(c)(3) public charity supporting a
sustainable ecosystem of funding for free and open-source projects and
contributors, and does not take a cut of donations to its [funds](/funds); 100%
of those donations are passed through to grantees, while a separate [Operations
Budget](/funds/ops) covers administrative and operational expenses.

Steak 'n Shake's commitment adds continuous and bitcoin-denominated support for
the developers, researchers, designers, and educators working on Bitcoin and
related public infrastructure. We appreciate their decision to connect their
bitcoin activity directly to open-source funding, and we thank everyone who
chooses to participate by ordering a Bitcoin Meal and paying with bitcoin.

If you share our commitment to free and open-source software for Bitcoin and
freedom tech, you can support OpenSats by donating to one of [our
funds](/funds).
