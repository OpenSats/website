OpenSats is proud to announce its eighth wave of Bitcoin grants, dedicated to
supporting innovative open-source projects that enhance the growth and
resilience of the Bitcoin ecosystem.

We remain committed to empowering developers worldwide who are building
groundbreaking tools, improving user experience, and strengthening the overall
security of Bitcoin and its users.

This wave awards grants to four outstanding projects, each playing a vital role
in advancing various aspects of the Bitcoin network. In no particular order, the
recipients are:

- [Citadel-Tech](#citadel-tech)
- [Lampo](#lampo)
- [Cashu Nutshell](#cashu-nutshell)
- [PickhardtPayments Plugin](#pickhardtpayments-plugin)

These grants are sourced from our General Fund, which directly supports
open-source projects. Sustained by donors who share our vision for a thriving,
decentralized future, 100% of General Fund donations go to Bitcoin-related
projects, not operational costs. To support these projects and help Bitcoin
flourish, please consider donating to the General Fund:

Let's take a closer look at these projects to discover their purpose, impact,
and the value they bring to the Bitcoin ecosystem.

### Citadel-Tech

Citadel-Tech is dedicated to advancing privacy within the Bitcoin ecosystem
through the development of an atomic swap protocol first proposed by Greg
Maxwell in 2013. By implementing the
[Maxwell-Belcher](https://gist.github.com/chris-belcher/9144bd57a91c194e332fb5ca371d0964)
protocol, the project enables truly private ownership transfers of
Bitcoin UTXOs between participants. With a focus on providing "passive privacy,"
even for non-users, this project ensures that swaps are indistinguishable from
standard Taproot transactions today.

### Lampo

Lampo is an open-source project that aims to build a modular and customizable
Lightning node implementation for the Bitcoin ecosystem. Designed to integrate
with the Lightning Development Kit (LDK) and the LNprototest test suite, Lampo
offers flexibility and innovation through features like a swappable API, wallet,
on-chain data source, and a plugin system similar to Core Lightning. Lampo is
positioned as a fully open-source alternative to company-driven Lightning
implementations, promoting greater interoperability, customization, and
experimentation within the Bitcoin and Lightning communities.

With the support of this grant, Lampo will focus on developing key features,
including a proof of concept (PoC) for the VLS signer, integration of LDK with
LNprototest, and the eventual implementation of BOLT12. The project will
prioritize bug fixes, improve Lampo's documentation, and introduce new tutorials
to foster greater accessibility and collaboration. By creating a truly
open-source Lightning node, Lampo supports the decentralization of financial
infrastructure and drives innovation in Lightning technology.

### Cashu Nutshell

Cashu Nutshell is an open-source Chaumian ecash system focused on enhancing
privacy for users of custodial Bitcoin applications. The system enables users to
make anonymous transactions without revealing their identity, balance, or
transaction history. Leveraging Cashu mints allows for private ecash exchanges,
preventing censorship and blocking of specific users. The project also
integrates with decentralized platforms like nostr, introducing features such as
private ecash receipts and [Proof of Liabilities
schemes](https://gist.github.com/callebtc/ed5228d1d8cbaade0104db5d1cf63939),
which allow users to confirm transactions and monitor mint operations without
compromising privacy.

With the support of this grant, Cashu Nutshell will implement [synthetic USD
e-cash](https://github.com/cashubtc/nutshell/pull/608) backed by LNMarkets,
providing a privacy-focused alternative to Tether for users in regions with
unstable fiat currencies. Key milestones include the development of [Discreet
Log Contracts](https://github.com/cashubtc/nutshell/pull/576) for ecash, and the
introduction of [private ecash
receipts](https://github.com/cashubtc/nuts/pull/155) using nostr.

### PickhardtPayments Plugin

PickhardtPayments, originally developed by [Rene
Pickhardt](https://opensats.org/blog/rene-pickhardt-receives-lts-grant) and
Stefan Richter, is a payment routing strategy aimed at improving the reliability
and efficiency of payments on the Lightning Network. This plugin project
focuses on implementing the Pickhardt-Richter model into Core Lightning via the
`renepay` plugin. The model uses advanced Bayesian analysis and ([Minimum Cost
Flow](https://github.com/Lagrang3/mcf-algorithms)) algorithms to calculate
optimal Multi-Path Payments, reducing payment failures due to liquidity
shortages, particularly for smaller and less connected nodes in the network.

With the support of this grant, the project will further develop and split the
payment process into two plugins—`askrene` for route computation and `renepay`
for payment management—improving modularity and flexibility. Future milestones
include adding support for BOLT12 invoices and solving non-linear cost problems
in payment routing. This ongoing work will enhance the Lightning Network's
payment layer, offering faster and more reliable payment experiences for users.

With this eighth wave of grants, as with [previous waves](/tags/wave), we
evaluated applications based on carefully [defined criteria](/apply#criteria)
and put forth our best efforts to select the most impactful and promising
proposals for the Bitcoin ecosystem. If you are a developer working on a project
aligned with [our mission](/mission), we encourage you to [apply for
funding](/apply).
