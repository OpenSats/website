summary: "OpenSats is funding five more open-source projects advancing the nostr ecosystem."
---

We're pleased to announce our eleventh wave of nostr grants. This round includes
support for projects focused on decentralized live streaming, off-grid
connectivity, web-of-trust infrastructure, private messaging, and open tools for
game development. These efforts represent a growing ecosystem of builders
working to expand nostr's capabilities while strengthening censorship resistance
and permissionless access.

The five projects receiving support in this wave are:

- [Swae](#swae)
- [HAMSTR](#hamstr)
- [Vertex](#vertex)
- [Nostr Double Ratchet](#nostr-double-ratchet)
- [Nostr Game Engine](#nostr-game-engine)

Our support for nostr is made possible by the generosity of our donors. Their
contributions help us support innovative, mission-aligned projects like these.
If you'd like to help sustain this work, consider donating to The Nostr Fund:

Let's look at these projects and how they align with our mission.

### Swae

Swae is a mobile-first live streaming application built on the nostr protocol,
supporting decentralized video broadcasts directly from smartphones. Designed to
operate in a permissionless environment, Swae allows creators to host and watch
streams with integrated Lightning-powered micropayments through Zaps. The
current prototype—available on TestFlight—supports nostr account creation,
live stream viewing, and stream initiation via
[RTMP](https://rtmp.veriskope.com/docs/overview/) URLs.

This grant will fund the deployment of a dedicated streaming server, integration
of real-time nostr chat, and expanded Lightning payment support. Additional
roadmap priorities include Cashu protocol support, a TikTok-style clip discovery
feature, and tools for stream analytics. Development will continue to focus on
core streaming reliability, improved payment flows, and scalable content
management.

### HAMSTR

HAMSTR enables nostr communication over ham radio, offering offline access to
the network in regions without internet, under censorship, or during
infrastructure outages. By bridging off-grid clients with internet-connected
relay gateways through packet radio, HAMSTR delivers resilient messaging
optimized for extremely low-bandwidth transmission. The current implementation
supports full [`kind:1`](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/10.md)
note exchange with compression, error correction, and local key storage—all
accessible via a web-based client.

Grant funding will support development across six milestones: allowing for
off-grid Zaps and ecash via
[NWC](https://github.com/getAlby/nostr-wallet-connect#) and
[Cashu](https://cashu.space/); offline bitcoin transaction support with a nostr
relay bot; GUI server tools for global operators;
[FLDIGI](https://sourceforge.net/p/fldigi/fldigi/ci/master/tree/README)
integration for long-range communications;
[Reticulum-based](https://reticulum.network/) encryption and routing; and a
flagship radio installation in Arizona to serve as a global access point. HAMSTR
aims to ensure decentralized communication and payments remain viable—even
when the internet is not.

### Vertex

Vertex provides Web of Trust infrastructure for nostr, helping client developers
filter spam, personalize content, and preserve decentralization. The service
continuously crawls nostr relays to map [the social
graph](https://pippellia.com/pippellia/Social+Graph/Navigating+the+social+graph)
and applies [PageRank-style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank) algorithms
to return relevance-ranked results through
[DVM](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/90.md) requests. The
project has shipped core tooling—including
[crawler](https://github.com/vertex-lab/crawler) and
[relay](https://github.com/vertex-lab/relay) software—and integrated its
[VerifyReputation](https://vertexlab.io/docs/nips/verify-reputation-dvm/) DVM
into live apps.

This grant will support the development of a Web of Trust-based search DVM for
discovering trusted profiles, a fast public key viewer with impersonator
detection, and algorithmic improvements using mutes and reports. Future updates
will focus on client-side verification of DVM responses and personalization
enhancements based on user interests and metadata—all while minimizing
infrastructure requirements for clients.

### Nostr Double Ratchet

Nostr Double Ratchet brings end-to-end encrypted private messaging to nostr
clients by offering a library that implements the [Double Ratchet][DR] algorithm. By
protecting message metadata and securing histories even if a user's nostr key is
compromised, this approach significantly enhances privacy across the network.
The protocol is currently available as a TypeScript library and integrated into
clients such as [Iris](https://iris.to/) and [Damus](https://damus.io/).
Complementary work includes a high-performance
[Rust/LMDB](https://crates.io/crates/nostr-lmdb) server for notifications and
webhook subscriptions.

Upcoming milestones include group messaging support, multi-device session
management [modeled on Signal](https://signal.org/docs/specifications/sesame/),
and the public release of Double Ratchet in Damus. The team also plans to
finalize and standardize the protocol through
[NIP-117](https://github.com/mmalmi/nips/blob/double-ratchet/117.md) and
[NIP-118](https://github.com/mmalmi/nips/blob/double-ratchet/118.md), expanding
integration across both web and native clients. This work aims to make secure,
decentralized messaging a native capability across the nostr ecosystem.

### Nostr Game Engine

[Nostr Game Engine](https://ngengine.org/) is building a free, open-source,
royalty-free engine for game developers—powered by nostr. Built using
[jMonkeyEngine](https://github.com/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine?tab=readme-ov-file#jmonkeyengine),
the project replaces traditional centralized systems with nostr-native modules
while preserving compatibility. The initial release consists of modular
extensions, with plans to evolve into a dedicated engine with improved
architecture.

This grant will support development across several areas: interoperable player
authorization via
[NIP-46](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/46.md) signers,
WebRTC signaling over nostr, in-game advertising via nostr-DAN, matchmaking,
social profiles via
[NIP-58](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/58.md), social
features ([NIP-17](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/17.md) and
[NIP-28](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/28.md)), DRM/release
tools, and micropayments via NWC, Cashu, and Lightning. The goal is to offer a
full-featured, cross-platform engine for browsers, desktops, and mobile that
requires only a nostr relay as the backend—significantly reducing
infrastructure burdens for independent creators.
