Announcing our fifth wave of nostr grants, aimed at driving innovation as well
as consistent and broad support across the nostr ecosystem.

Since [our last wave of grants](/blog/nostr-grants-december-2023), the protocol
has seen [continual growth](https://stats.nostr.band/) and incredible progress.
Nostr’s integration with the Lightning Network continues to make
[zaps](https://zaplife.lol/) (bitcoin-based micro transactions) a breeze. These
frictionless payments create the perfect environment for economic activity and
open up new income opportunities for independent journalists, artists, and
creators in general. As Lightning & eCash mature and continue their path of
[tightly integrating with nostr][nutsack], and with the emergence of
nostr-native P2P marketplaces, economic activity across the network is bound to
grow.

As an open protocol, it's in nostr's DNA to integrate with other open protocols.
One such effort is the [Mostr bridge](https://mostr.pub/), which connects nostr
with the wider Fediverse (and vice-versa). Gone are the days of walled gardens.
May the best open protocol win! Or even better: let a thousand flowers bloom
(and interop with each other).

It should be obvious  by now that nostr is way more than just a “twitter clone.”
From self-sovereign identity to decentralized identity system & social graph, to
web-of-trust and a base for secure communication frameworks, the potential uses
for nostr are vast and ever-growing.

We hope that our grants will allow developers to build on the existing momentum,
helping to ensure that nostr stays at the cutting edge of permissionless social
media, self-sovereign identity, and social payments of _real_ money online.

Without further ado, the 5th wave of nostr grants is going to:

- [nosvelte](#nosvelte)
- [npub.cash](#npubcash)
- [nostter](#nostter)
- [nostr-filter-relay](#nostr-filter-relay)
- [Mostro](#mostro)
- [Citrine](#citrine)
- [DVMDash](#dvmdash)
- [nostr-php](#nostr-php)
- [Shopstr](#shopstr)
- [Nostrmo](#nostrmo)
- [Captain’s Log](#captains-log)

Including these eleven projects, we have now issued a total of 57 grants to
various nostr projects. See our [1st](/blog/nostr-grants-july-2023),
[2nd](/blog/bitcoin-and-nostr-grants-august-2023),
[3rd](/blog/nostr-grants-october-2023), and [4th
wave](/blog/nostr-grants-december-2023) blog posts for details. Additionally, we
are providing long-term support for exceptional nostr developers such as
[Pablo](/blog/pablofz7-receives-lts-grant),
[Stuart](/blog/stuart-bowman-receives-lts-grant),
[hzrd149](/blog/hzrd149-receives-lts-grant),
[Will](/blog/jb55-receives-lts-grant), and
[Yuki](/blog/yuki-receives-lts-grant)—and we’ll have more grants to announce
soon.
