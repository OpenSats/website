OpenSats is pleased to announce long-term support for
[m1sterc001guy](https://github.com/m1sterc001guy/) for his continued
contributions to the Bitcoin ecosystem.

m1sterc001guy is the primary maintainer of the [Fedimint Lightning
Gateway](https://fedibtc.github.io/fedi-docs/docs/gateways/intro/), playing an
instrumental role in connecting federated communities to the wider Bitcoin
Lightning network, enabling seamless payment experiences.

As an [independent
contributor](https://github.com/fedimint/fedimint/commits?author=m1sterc001guy&before=90a2fb72e8b52660911aea69919a8bdc1fa20ebc+70),
he has made substantial enhancements that have strengthened Fedimint's
functionality. His key improvements in database transactions, support for LND
and LDK, and advancements in resilience, crash recovery, and backup systems have
fortified Fedimint's security and accessibility for bitcoin custody. He has also
built [ROASTr](https://github.com/m1sterc001guy/roastr#), an independent
Fedimint module that allows federations to collaboratively sign nostr notes.

With this grant, m1sterc001guy will focus on:

- Enhancing gateway features by integrating BOLT12 support, transaction logging,
  profit tracking, and LSP specifications.
- Developing new modules by building federated co-signing solutions using FROST,
  expanding flexible custody options.
- Improving usability by developing new debugging tools, refining the UI, and
  optimizing federation management.

>My goal is improve Fedimint's Lightning user experience and to bridge the
>functionality between federated ecash and the Lightning network. I want
>Lightning Gateways to be an easy tool for node operators to use, to expand the
>utility of their Lightning node, and to provide Lightning payments for their
>community.

These upgrades will make Fedimint a more versatile tool for many Bitcoin use
cases by providing secure and private custody solutions, especially for
community-focused applications.
