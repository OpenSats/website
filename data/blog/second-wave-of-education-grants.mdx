in Costa Rica. The project focuses on educating businesses and individuals on
Bitcoin usage, offering free technology services like point-of-sale systems and
wallets, and fostering community through meetups and events. Future plans

### Bitcoin Indonesia

Bitcoin Indonesia is a community-driven grassroots initiative focused on Bitcoin
adoption across Indonesia, emphasizing education, community building, and
open-source development. With a mission to empower the nation's 280 million
people through financial education and access to freedom technologies like
Bitcoin and Lightning, they provide diverse learning opportunities, from daily
workshops and meetups at Bitcoin House Bali to outreach in schools and
universities. Future plans include expanding their developer community, growing
the Bitcoin circular economy, and advocating for Bitcoin-friendly policies. By
bridging education, community support, and technological development, they aim
to foster financial inclusion and self-sovereignty in a country where 77% of the
population is unbanked or underbanked, highlighting Bitcoin's potential as a
tool for economic empowerment and human rights.

### Deciphering Bitcoin

Deciphering Bitcoin is an open-source project to create a comprehensive academic
textbook on Bitcoin, covering its design, purpose, and societal impact. The book
will be freely available on GitHub and accompanied by a user-friendly website
featuring interactive courses for varying levels of technical expertise. The
project is structured into a core section, focusing on fundamental aspects of
Bitcoin like network architecture, mining, and wallets, and an advanced topics
section that explores subjects like the Lightning Network and Bitcoin's role in
financial privacy. Future plans include developing these educational resources
to serve university students, professionals, and the broader public, offering a
modular, interdisciplinary approach that fills a critical gap in the current
academic landscape by providing a thorough and unbiased analysis of Bitcoin.

leads and contributors from complementary projects such as StratumV2, Braidpool,
and Pivotal Pleb Tech (the Loki board). The residency offers participants
funding, workspaces, design support, and opportunities for collaboration to
advance decentralization in Bitcoin mining. As part of the program, residents

### Satsie's Pocket Guides

Satsie's Pocket Guides are short, handmade zines that simplify complex Bitcoin
technical topics, making them accessible to a wider audience. Covering subjects
like BIPs, Taproot, Stratum V2, and Payjoin, these zines are printed, sewn, and
distributed by the creator at conferences and meetups, with digital versions
available for download. The project aims to cater to various learning styles by
providing tangible, distraction-free educational materials that break down dense
concepts for the technically curious. Future plans include expanding
distribution to more U.S.-based Bitcoin events and communities while encouraging
global adoption through downloadable, self-assembled versions.

solutions into existing financial infrastructures, driving innovation and
improving transaction efficiency on the continent. By building a skilled
developer community, the project aims to foster local adoption of advanced
Bitcoin technologies, attract global Lightning companies, and position Africa as
a key hub for fintech innovation. Future boot camps are planned for Nairobi,
Cape Town, and Accra.
