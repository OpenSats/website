We’re pleased to announce our latest wave of grants, supporting a mix of
protocol research, core infrastructure maintenance, privacy-preserving wallets,
and mining decentralization—work that benefits Bitcoin’s resilience as an open
monetary network.

This wave includes eight first-time grants and seven grant renewals. The
projects and contributors in this round span different layers of the stack, from
protocol-level work and Lightning infrastructure to operating systems, wallets,
mining coordination, and Bitcoin Core maintenance. Together, they reflect a
shared focus on strengthening Bitcoin as a public good by improving safety,
decentralization, usability, and the ability for independent contributors to
participate over the long term.

### BlindBit Suite

BlindBit Suite is a collection of open-source tools focused on making Silent
Payments practical and easy to use across different Bitcoin setups. The suite
includes [BlindBit Oracle], an indexer that serves Silent Payments–specific data
in a privacy-preserving way, and [BlindBit Desktop], a background wallet that
continuously scans for incoming Silent Payments. [BlindBit Scan] is a
lightweight, self-hostable service that keeps wallets up to date by querying
Oracle. [BlindBit Spend] is a mobile wallet that connects to Scan to spend
discovered UTXOs without doing on-device scanning. Together with supporting
libraries, these components aim to reduce the heavy scanning burden that Silent
Payments impose while preserving strong privacy for users and developers.

With support from this grant, the project will focus on making each component
stable and ready for regular use. BlindBit Desktop will move through alpha and
beta testing toward a 1.0.0 release, while BlindBit Oracle will be optimized for
higher performance and heavier loads, including work on faster sync and improved
storage backends. BlindBit Scan will be prepared for a 1.0.0 release as a
private scanner with easy self-hosting via Docker on platforms like [Umbrel] and
[Start9]. BlindBit Spend will be cleaned up, tested, and prepared for wider
distribution on Android and iOS. The project will also explore enhancements such
as DM-style notifications between senders and receivers and GPU-accelerated
scanning, with the goal of making Silent Payments adoption more accessible for
both desktop and mobile users relying on remote scanners.

### Dana Wallet

[Dana Wallet] is a mobile bitcoin wallet built for the donation use case and
designed around [silent payments]. It does not offer receiving on legacy
addresses, which removes the risk of accidental address reuse and helps protect
user privacy. Incoming payments are discovered using a [BIP158]-like structure
with local scanning, meaning no external server learns which addresses belong to
the user. The wallet is also built around [BIP353] “email-like” payment
identifiers, replacing copy-and-paste address flows with a more familiar and
streamlined experience for donors and recipients.

With support from this grant, Dana Wallet aims to move into a production-ready
release, including a stable build on the Google Play Store. The work will focus
on error handling, reliable recovery through chain rescans, and basic security
features such as PIN or biometric protection. Beyond those core milestones, the
project plans to improve the speed and consistency of scanning, allow users to
register their own “username@danawallet.app” addresses, improve the
transaction history view, and add features like offline mode and flexible
denomination display. Over time, the project may introduce a contact list, and
notifications between Dana Wallet users to make receiving silent payments more
seamless.

### Daniel Pfeifer

[Daniel Pfeifer] is focused on improving the long-term maintainability, safety,
and clarity of the Bitcoin Core codebase. His work centers on cleaning up the
build system by replacing ad-hoc scripts and undocumented conventions with
declarative, reproducible [CMake] configurations, and on refactoring C++
components so they are easier to understand and work on in isolation. This
includes enforcing clear ownership rules in the code and removing unsafe
constructs. He also aims to define, document, and promote modern [C++ coding
guidelines] within the Bitcoin community, drawing on his involvement with the
ISO C++ Committee, and to develop the [BtcK] multi-language API so that
different programming languages can talk to Bitcoin Core through consistent,
idiomatic bindings. Alongside this, Daniel prioritizes C++ education and
mentorship.

With support from this grant, Daniel will focus on concrete near-term milestones
that support future architectural improvements. These include helping to prepare
a stable C API for the [Bitcoin Kernel library], ensuring its SDK is deployed
cleanly, and replacing platform-specific packaging scripts with a unified CPack
definition.

### FreeBSD

[FreeBSD] is an operating system used across servers, desktops, and embedded
platforms, and is the most widely deployed of the [BSD family], second only to
Linux among open-source operating systems. This project maintains the
FreeBSD/EC2 platform, ensuring that FreeBSD runs reliably on [Amazon EC2] by
producing and supporting cloud images and coordinating with the wider project.

With support from this grant, [Colin Percival] will continue engineering work
around the newly released [FreeBSD 15.0], including EC2 image builds and work on
[future branches] to improve robustness and security in cloud environments.
