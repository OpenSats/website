We’re pleased to announce our latest wave of grants, supporting a mix of
protocol research, infrastructure maintenance, privacy-preserving wallets, and
mining decentralization—work that benefits Bitcoin’s resilience as an open
monetary network.

This wave includes six first-time grants and seven grant renewals. The projects
and contributors supported in this round span multiple parts of the ecosystem,
including developer tooling, wallets, infrastructure work, and education
initiatives. Together, they reflect a shared focus on strengthening Bitcoin as a
public good by improving safety, decentralization, usability, and the ability
for independent contributors to participate over the long term.

### Braidpool

While we have [supported Braidpool] in the past, this additional grant supports
developer [Mohd Zaid] for his work on the project’s auditability and payout
accounting. Building on Braidpool’s braid-like Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) of
“[beads]”, Mohd has been working on two core pieces of infrastructure: an [Audit
Mode] proxy that transparently logs mining activity into the DAG to create a
tamper-evident record of work performed, and an Unspent Hash Payout Output
([UHPO]) module that serves as an auditable accounting layer for tracking what
each miner is owed and how payouts are constructed.

With this grant, Mohd will focus on turning these components into robust tools
that miners and ecosystem partners can rely on. He will implement and strengthen
Audit Mode, including the pass-through proxy, the DAG logic for anchoring mining
events, and privacy features that let miners selectively share contribution data
with contract counterparties. Mohd will then design and build out the UHPO
module, defining its data model, core operations for tracking balances and
settlement, and the logic to generate valid payout transactions. In the final
phase, he plans to integrate Audit Mode and UHPO while researching and
prototyping decentralized signing with [FROST] or similar threshold schemes,
followed by comprehensive functional and integration testing. The goal is to
provide an open-source foundation for transparent mining accounting and
hashrate-linked financial tools, reducing dependence on centralized pool
infrastructure.

### BlindBit Suite

BlindBit Suite is a collection of open-source tools focused on making Silent
Payments practical and easy to use across different Bitcoin setups. The suite
includes [BlindBit Oracle], an indexer that serves Silent Payments–specific data
in a privacy-preserving way, and [BlindBit Desktop], a background wallet that
continuously scans for incoming Silent Payments. Two additional components round
out the suite: [BlindBit Scan], a lightweight, self-hostable service that keeps
wallets up to date by querying Oracle, and [BlindBit Spend], a mobile wallet
that connects to Scan to spend discovered UTXOs without doing on-device
scanning. Together with supporting libraries, these components aim to reduce the
heavy scanning burden that Silent Payments impose while preserving strong
privacy for users and developers.

With support from this grant, the project will focus on making each component
stable and ready for regular use. BlindBit Desktop will move through alpha and
beta testing toward a 1.0.0 release, while BlindBit Oracle will be optimized for
higher performance and heavier loads, including work on faster sync and improved
storage backends. BlindBit Scan will be prepared for a 1.0.0 release as a
private scanner with easy self-hosting via Docker on platforms like [Umbrel] and
[Start9]. BlindBit Spend will be cleaned up, tested, and prepared for wider
distribution on Android and iOS. The project will also explore enhancements such
as DM-style notifications between senders and receivers and GPU-accelerated
scanning, with the goal of making Silent Payments adoption more accessible for
both desktop and mobile users relying on remote scanners.

### Dana Wallet

[Dana Wallet] is a mobile bitcoin wallet designed around [silent payments]. It
does not offer receiving on legacy addresses, which removes the risk of
accidental address reuse and helps protect user privacy. Incoming payments are
discovered using a [BIP158]-like structure with local scanning, meaning no
external server learns which addresses belong to the user. The wallet is also
built around [BIP353] “email-like” payment identifiers, replacing copy-and-paste
address flows with a more familiar and streamlined experience for senders and
recipients.

With support from this grant, Dana Wallet aims to move into a production-ready
release, including a stable build on the Google Play Store. The work will focus
on error handling, reliable recovery through chain rescans, and basic security
features such as PIN or biometric protection. Beyond those core milestones, the
project plans to improve the speed and consistency of scanning, allow users to
register their own `username@danawallet.app` addresses, improve the transaction
history view, and add features like offline mode and flexible denomination
display. Over time, the project may introduce a contact list, and notifications
between Dana Wallet users to make receiving silent payments more seamless.

### FreeBSD

[FreeBSD] is an operating system used across servers, desktops, and embedded
platforms, and is the most widely deployed of the [BSD family], second only to
Linux among open-source operating systems. This project maintains the
FreeBSD/EC2 platform, ensuring that FreeBSD runs reliably on [Amazon EC2] by
producing and supporting cloud images and coordinating with the wider project.
This work underpins operating system diversity for critical infrastructure,
which is important for Bitcoin operators who cannot rely on a single-kernel
monoculture.

With support from this grant, [Colin Percival] will continue engineering work
around the newly released [FreeBSD 15.0], including EC2 image builds and
coordination needed to keep the release stable and supported. Additional work
will extend to [future branches], addressing larger changes and issues deferred
from 15.0 and improving the robustness and security of FreeBSD in cloud
environments. The goal is to ensure that FreeBSD remains a well-maintained
operating system option for long-term infrastructure, including those in the
Bitcoin ecosystem that rely on operating system diversity to reduce systemic
risk.

### LaWallet

[LaWallet] is a Lightning wallet stack designed to make bitcoin onboarding
simple and practical for communities. It provides Lightning Addresses,
[BoltCards] for NFC payments, [Nostr Wallet Connect] as the backend, and can be
deployed for free on platforms like [Vercel] or [Netlify] to give users an
instant Lightning wallet experience. The same stack can run on self-hosted
platforms such as Umbrel or Start9, where communities offer courtesy NWC
accounts and guide users toward operating their own infrastructure. LaWallet’s
core idea is progressive custody, where users can start with hosted providers
and later move to their own node without changing their interface or habits.
This model is already being deployed with [VEINTIUNO.LAT] across several
circular economies.

With support from this grant, LaWallet will focus on improving the stack through
heavy testing, bug fixes, and completion of the admin dashboard. The project
aims to have at least ten circular communities running the platform, improving
the simple wallet frontend, NWC integrations, and BoltCard flows based on user
feedback. Additional work will refine the deployment and management experience
for operators, making it easier for grassroots initiatives to roll out Lightning
Addresses, POS devices, and NFC cards while progressively guiding new users
toward self-custody.

### LNHANCE

The LNHANCE Expedition project explores the proposed [LNhance soft fork] for
Bitcoin by building and analyzing proof-of-concept implementations of [Eltoo]
channels, hash-lock Ark ([hArk]), and [vaults], with a focus on
OP_CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY ([CTV]) and OP_CHECKSIGFROMSTACK ([CSFS]). Its goal is to
understand the practical viability, limitations, and tradeoffs of these new
opcodes in real-world channel, Ark, and vault designs. Current work centers on a
CTV-only vault that uses a predefined spending plan to control how quickly funds
can be moved, support a large number of deposits and withdrawals, and provide a
secure recovery path with clear limitations for users, alongside tools,
documentation, educational materials, and reusable libraries that help other
developers adopt these designs.

With support from this grant, the project will complete the CTV-only vault proof
of concept, refine its command-line and minimal graphical interfaces, and
document the CTV precomputed state machine design for both general and technical
audiences. It will then implement Eltoo channels using CTV and CSFS in [LDK] and
extend this work to multiparty Eltoo using a precomputed settlement state
machine, comparing on-chain efficiency and design tradeoffs with existing
approaches. Further work will apply CTV and CSFS to [Ark-like protocols] by
implementing hArk in [bark] and exploring related designs such as [Erk]. The
project will also simulate multiparty Eltoo coinpools as non-custodial payout
mechanisms for decentralized miners such as
[Braidpool](https://opensats.org/blog/bitcoin-grants-feb-2024#braidpool), and
investigate additional vault designs, including social recovery, offline key
delegation, and deleted key recursion aimed at reducing precomputation overhead
to levels suitable for hardware wallets.
