---

OpenSats extends a warm welcome to Tobin Harding, our newest LTS grantee hailing
from the Central Coast of New South Wales where he lives by the mantra
*”Code, Roll, Dive, Breath - Repeat.”*

In the heart of the kernel mini-conf at the Perth LCA nine years ago, Tobin felt
a spark of inspiration as he overheard discussions about patching the kernel -
"I want to do that." And the rest, as they say, is history.

With the backing of this LTS grant, he is now set to keep achieving significant
milestones for [rust-bitcoin](https://github.com/rust-bitcoin), crucial to
projects like [Fedimint](https://github.com/fedimint/fedimint),
[LDK](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/ldk-sample),
[BDK](https://github.com/bitcoindevkit/bdk), and
[electrs](https://github.com/romanz/electrs).

Tobin's overarching goal is to get
[rust-bitcoin](https://github.com/rust-bitcoin/rust-bitcoin) to a version 1.0.0 release,
along with underlying components such as
[rust-secp256k1](https://github.com/rust-bitcoin/rust-secp256k1),
[rust-bech32](https://github.com/rust-bitcoin/rust-bech32),
[bitcoin_hashes](https://github.com/rust-bitcoin/bitcoin_hashes), and others.
He is also focused on the effort of reviewing every public type and function, a
meticulous process that often involves extensive discussions. This effort promises
a stable API with minimal changes that developers can rely on.

On top of that, he’ll persist in iterating on the API to maintain its alignment
with [Rust API design principles](https://github.com/rust-lang/api-guidelines),
ensuring user-friendliness for both experienced Bitcoin developers and
newcomers. Complementing this, Tobin is dedicated to delivering clear and
accessible documentation. He’s also simultaneously working on a v2 of his
[rust-PSBT](https://github.com/tcharding/rust-psbt) implementation.

All of Tobin’s work lines up perfectly with the goal of the LTS program:
building a stronger, more resilient Bitcoin network by fostering long-term
stability for open-source developers.

If you’re a fellow [load-bearing internet person][lbip], OpenSats invites you to
