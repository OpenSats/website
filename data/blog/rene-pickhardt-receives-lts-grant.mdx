We are very excited to award a Long-term Support Grant to [René
Pickhardt](https://ln.rene-pickhardt.de/), helping him continue his fundamental
research on improving Bitcoin’s overall usefulness as a payment system through
the Lightning Network.

Fueled by gratitude for his scholarship from the [German National Academic
Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studienstiftung), his four consecutive
[Bitcoin Developer
Grants](https://blog.bitmex.com/renewal-of-rene-pickhardts-bitcoin-developer-grant-3/)
from BitMEX, and the everyday benefits of the open-source software he uses, René
has centered his career on giving back to the communities that supported him on
his path.

He has consistently shared commercially significant knowledge for a long time
without seeking prior funding. All major LN implementations have integrated some
of his research results and algorithms, now widely recognized as the most
optimal for bitcoin payments.

Over the years, he has achieved an almost endless list of invaluable
contributions, including creating [Pickhardt
Payments](https://github.com/renepickhardt/pickhardtpayments), actively
answering most questions about the LN on [Stack
Exchange](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/users/81940/rene-pickhardt),
co-authoring the openly licensed book "[Mastering the Lightning
Network](https://github.com/lnbook/lnbook)," proposing [Just in Time
Routing](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2019-March/001891.html),
mentoring at [Chaincode Labs Lightning
Residency](https://residency.chaincode.com/), and [Summer of
Bitcoin](https://www.summerofbitcoin.org/mentors), as well as responsibly
disclosing a blackmail attack related to channel jamming (don’t worry, he didn’t
have to blackmail us for this glowing review!)

This LTS grant is now instrumental in René's ongoing efforts to enhance reliable
payment planning, efficient payment routing, and explore innovative liquidity
management strategies on the Lightning Network. 
He is currently focused on researching [non-minimum cost flow-based
methods][methods] to optimize the expected delivery of sats and is inviting
feedback on [this question][question] about how to compute the expected number
of sats to arrive in a probabilistic payment flow.

[question]: https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/117447/how-to-compute-the-expected-number-of-sats-to-arrive-in-a-probabilistic-payment

What’s more, he’s planning to host free online webinars. These sessions aim to
bridge the gap between theoretical research and practical application by making
the complex technical details of his papers easily understandable.

Big thanks to our generous donors for making this possible. If you are
interested in contributing to the funding of Bitcoin infrastructure, please
consider donating to our General Fund.
