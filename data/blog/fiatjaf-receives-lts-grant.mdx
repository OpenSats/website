---

OpenSats is proud to announce long-term support for
[fiatjaf](https://github.com/fiatjaf), a run-of-the-mill nostr developer.

Before nostr, fiatjaf's primary focus was on building tools for Bitcoin's
Lightning Network, having contributed to projects like
[lntxbot](https://github.com/fiatjaf/lntxbot),
[c-lightning](https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning/commits?author=fiatjaf),
[lnbits](https://github.com/lnbits/lnbits/commits?author=fiatjaf), and creating
[LNURL tools](https://github.com/fiatjaf/go-lnurl).

When he is not cheering for Drivechains or writing [inflammatory posts about how
everybody is wrong](https://njump.me/fiatjaf.com), he spends his time looking at
NIPs and trying to make nostr suck a little less.

This LTS grant will enable fiatjaf to focus on some of his nostr side projects,
such as
[nostr-tools](https://github.com/nbd-wtf/nostr-tools),
[nos2x](https://github.com/fiatjaf/nos2x),
[go-nostr](https://github.com/nbd-wtf/go-nostr),
[khatru](https://github.com/fiatjaf/khatru),
[eventstore](https://github.com/fiatjaf/eventstore),
[njump](https://njump.me/about), [loure](https://github.com/fiatjaf/loure),
[wikistr](https://github.com/fiatjaf/wikistr),
[patch34](https://github.com/fiatjaf/patch34),
[nak](https://github.com/fiatjaf/nak),
[gitstr](https://github.com/fiatjaf/gitstr),
[song](https://git.fiatjaf.com/song), [mmm](https://git.fiatjaf.com/mmm), and
[promenade](https://git.fiatjaf.com/promenade). Who knows what these tools will
be good for. (We're not even sure he knows.)

Some other projects he wants to work on are:

- a [NIP-29](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/29.md) GTK4 desktop client,
- a competing solution to [Ditto](https://ditto.pub/), and
- a custom relay using `khatru` and `mmm`.

Our mission at OpenSats is to provide sustainable funding for those who work on
the freedom tech of tomorrow. We believe that free and open-source software
tools in general, and Bitcoin in particular, are essential to the future of the
internet and the world. (And nostr is neat too, of course. We wonder who came up
with it.)

Long-term support is awarded to individuals making significant contributions to
the open-source ecosystem within Bitcoin and nostr, and we are excited to extend
our support to a developer like fiatjaf.

Our [LTS program](/blog/nostr-lts-long-term-support-for-nostr-developers) is
made possible by generous donors like you. To help us continue supporting
important open-source contributors, consider making a donation to [The Nostr
Fund](/funds/nostr):
