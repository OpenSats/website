---

In alignment with our mission to maintain a robust Bitcoin ecosystem, OpenSats
is proud to announce a new round of grants dedicated to advancing Bitcoin Core
development. These grants aim to empower developers—both seasoned and
emerging—to strengthen, refine, and innovate on Bitcoin's reference
implementation.

This round includes support for three dedicated developers focused on
maintaining and improving Bitcoin Core:

- [@L0rinc](#l0rinc)
- [@kevkevinpal](#kevkevinpal)
- [@danielabrozzoni](#danielabrozzoni)

Each grantee will focus on key aspects of Bitcoin Core, from enhancing the
[Initial Block
Download](https://bitcoin.org/en/full-node#initial-block-downloadibd) (IBD)
process and optimizing database performance to deepening code reviews and
improving test coverage. Their efforts are essential to maintaining and
strengthening Bitcoin's reliability, accessibility, and decentralization.

These grants are made possible by generous donor support to our [General
Fund](/funds/general). If you'd like to support open-source projects that
fortify Bitcoin's foundation, please consider donating.

### @L0rinc

[L0rinc](https://github.com/l0rinc) is dedicated to improving Bitcoin Core's
performance and reliability by optimizing Initial Block Download (IBD), block
storage, and database functionality. His ongoing efforts include benchmarking
standardization, enhancing code quality, and addressing long-term challenges
such as replacing the unmaintained
[LevelDB](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/leveldb/README.md)
database.

This grant will power L0rinc's continued contributions to Bitcoin Core,
including performance optimizations that reduce IBD times and improve memory
usage. With a proven track record of impactful commits and collaboration, his
work will ensure Bitcoin Core remains robust, efficient, and sustainable for
years to come, supporting the overall resilience of the Bitcoin network.

### @kevkevinpal

[Kevin](https://github.com/kevkevinpal) is dedicated to maintaining Bitcoin
Core, focusing on improving its stability, security, and usability. His
contributions include addressing bugs, reviewing pull requests, enhancing test
coverage, and exploring advanced testing techniques like [fuzz
testing](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/fuzzing.md). By
optimizing continuous integration processes, Kevin supports the development
workflow and ensures the long-term health of Bitcoin Core.

With this grant, Kevin will continue his work by expanding on these efforts,
delivering meaningful changes such as additional bug fixes, improved test
coverage, and active participation in community initiatives like weekly IRC
meetings and PR review clubs. He also supports the network by running a full
node built on the Erlay branch, contributing to research on p2p efficiency.
Looking ahead, Kevin aims to take on larger contributions, such as reviewing and
implementing key features or BIPs, to further strengthen Bitcoin Core's
resilience and usability.

### @danielabrozzoni

[Daniela](http://github.com/danielabrozzoni) is focused on becoming a full-time,
productive contributor to Bitcoin Core by enhancing her expertise through code
reviews, feature contributions, and test coverage. Currently, in the onboarding
phase, she is working on reviewing pull requests to familiarize herself with the
codebase and build the skills needed to take on larger, more impactful
contributions.

This grant will support Daniela's efforts to transition into a long-term role
within Bitcoin Core. Her goal is to review key pull requests, contribute
regularly to the codebase, and enhance Bitcoin Core's infrastructure,
particularly in areas such as testing and maintenance. Her work is vital to
ensuring the continued reliability and resilience of the Bitcoin network.
