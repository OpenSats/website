OpenSats is pleased to announce our fourteenth wave of grants from the General
Fund, providing support to four first-time recipients and six grant renewals.

This round focuses on practical infrastructure by expanding access to test
networks, making full nodes easier to run, improving transparency in Lightning
payments, and reducing operational friction for ecash systems.

The four first-time grant recipients are:

- [Orchard](#orchard)
- [Floresta](#floresta)
- [Alt Signetfaucet](#alt-signetfaucet)
- [Lightning Detective](#lightning-detective)

The six grant renewals will go to:

- BTCPay Server ([Jul. 2023](/blog/bitcoin-grants-july-2023#btcpay-server))
- Stratum V2 ([Aug. 2023](/blog/bitcoin-and-nostr-grants-august-2023#stratum-v2-testing--benchmarking-tool))
- Cove ([Jul. 2024](/blog/bitcoin-grants-july-2024#cove))
- Satsie's Pocket Guides ([Sep. 2024](/blog/second-wave-of-education-grants#satsies-pocket-guides))
- Daniella Brozzoni ([Jan. 2025](/blog/more-for-core#danielabrozzoni))
- L0rinc ([Jan. 2025](/blog/more-for-core#l0rinc))

Each of these projects contributes to keeping Bitcoin decentralized,
transparent, and user-driven, while ensuring it remains robust and accessible.

None of this would be possible without the generosity of our donors. If you'd
like to help move Bitcoin forward by supporting projects like those in this
wave, consider donating to our General Fund.

Let's take a closer look at these projects to discover their purpose, impact,
and the value they bring to the Bitcoin ecosystem.

### Orchard

[Orchard][orchard] is a web application that unifies multiple tools to operate a
Cashu mint. Mint operators today rely on command-line tools, SQL queries, and
separate dashboards for Bitcoin, Lightning nodes, and other services, which
makes operations fragmented and prone to errors. Orchard provides a single
interface that integrates [LND][lnd], [Taproot Assets][taproot-assets] (`tapd`),
[Cashu implementations][cashu] like `CDK` and `Nutshell`, and an AI interface
powered by [Ollama][ollama]. Its modular architecture allows each service to be
toggled on or off, letting operators start small and expand as needed.

With support from OpenSats, Orchard will add revenue features and backups for
Cashu mints, improve authentication and observability, increase trust through
event logs and multi-user support, add support for Lightning implementations
beyond LND, including [CLN][cln], and improve long-term sustainability with test
suites, documentation, and research into revenue models. These efforts aim to
reduce the learning curve for new operators, increase the number and quality of
Cashu mints, and demonstrate how Bitcoin infrastructure can be improved through
the convergence of open-source software and AI.

### Floresta

Floresta is a modular and lightweight Bitcoin full node written in Rust that
uses the [Utreexo dynamic accumulator][utreexo], a cryptographic technique that
maintains a compact set of unspent coins (the UTXO set). While
[Floresta][floresta] has previously received OpenSats' support, this is
contributor [Jaoleal][jaoleal]'s first grant for his work on the project. To
date, the project has delivered `libfloresta`, a reusable library for building
Bitcoin applications, and `florestad`, a daemon that includes a view-only wallet
and an integrated Electrum server. By combining pruning with Utreexo, Floresta
has reduced storage requirements and sync times, making it possible to run full
nodes on resource-constrained devices while still independently verifying
Bitcoin.

With support from OpenSats, Floresta will expand its RPC interface to align more
closely with Bitcoin Core, enabling developers and infrastructure providers to
integrate it more easily into existing applications. It will also be packaged
for [nix-bitcoin][nix-bitcoin] and upstream [nixpkgs][nixpkgs], making
deployment seamless for users of [NixOS][nixos]. Alongside these milestones, the
project will continue to conduct code reviews, provide contributor support, and
maintain its long-term stability, ensuring it remains both technically robust
and accessible to a growing community of developers and users.

### Alt Signetfaucet

[Alt Signetfaucet][alt-signetfaucet] is a Bitcoin faucet for the Signet test
network, built in a [POSIX][posix] shell using only Bitcoin Core and BusyBox.
Running since March 2025, it provides a reliable way for learners and developers
to access test bitcoin for experimentation. By offering these test coins, the
faucet makes it easier to practice Bitcoin transactions, test applications, or
teach others how the network works. It supports a wide range of transaction
formats, including older public key types (P2PK with uncompressed keys), and its
activity can be tracked openly through the [mempool.space Signet
explorer][mempool-explorer].

With support from OpenSats, the project will document its current design,
identify areas for improvement, and make updates to ensure the faucet is more
robust and user-friendly. Planned milestones include running a faucet on a
custom [Signet][signet] network that produces blocks at a steady pace, and
refining the underlying `bitcoin-faucet-shell` code into a tool that anyone can
deploy. These efforts aim to expand access to test bitcoins, ensuring it is
easier for developers, educators, and new users to explore and learn about
Bitcoin safely.

### Lightning Detective

Lightning Detective is a Rust library and web service that analyzes Lightning
invoices to determine the likely recipient. It works with the standard format
used in the Lightning Network ([BOLT-11][bolt-11]) and compares invoice data
with the public Lightning graph to classify the payee as a custodial service, a
non-custodial wallet, or another type of provider. The tool can match well-known
public nodes directly, for example, by identifying custodial wallets like Wallet
of Satoshi, and can also detect wallets that rely on Lightning Service Providers
([LSPs][lsps]), such as Phoenix, through ACINQ's infrastructure. A public demo
is available at [detective.lipa.dev][detective].

With support from OpenSats, the project will expand its coverage and improve
usability. Planned work includes detecting the target network, adding support
for common Lightning payment methods like [LNURL-Pay][lnurl-pay] and Lightning
Addresses, exposing more invoice details, and improving error handling to
provide more reliable results. These updates will make the library easier for
developers to integrate into applications, while ensuring researchers and users
have clearer insight into payment flows and wallet usage patterns across the
Lightning Network.

From new tools for testing and education, to infrastructure that improves
payments and node operation, this wave of grants reflects the broad range of
work required to keep Bitcoin decentralized and resilient. By supporting both
new contributors and established projects, we aim to ensure that open-source
software and research remain freely available to anyone who wishes to build,
learn, or transact on Bitcoin.

To date, OpenSats has issued [328 grants](/transparency), underscoring both the
scale of our program and the ongoing need to sustain open-source contributors
building across the ecosystem. If you are working on a project that advances
Bitcoin, we encourage you to [apply for funding](/apply).

Our work is made possible by the generosity of our donors. To help make the
future of free and open-source development more sustainable, please consider
setting up a recurring donation to one of our funds. Every contribution makes a
difference.
