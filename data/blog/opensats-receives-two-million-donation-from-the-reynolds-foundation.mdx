---

We are delighted to share that [The Reynolds Foundation] has made an additional
\$2,000,000 donation to OpenSats, directed to our General Fund, following [a
\$1,000,000 gift last year].

Bitcoin development is a long-distance effort. OpenSats' focus is on providing
steady funding, and [long-term support] so contributors can work on freedom tech
without compromising on mission or time horizon. This generous donation helps us
provide that support.

OpenSats is a 501(c)(3) public charity dedicated to maintaining sustainable
funding for free and open-source projects and contributors, with a focus on
Bitcoin and projects that help Bitcoin flourish. 100% of donations to [our
funds] are used to directly support projects and contributors, while our
[operational budget] is funded separately.

The Reynolds Foundation emphasizes bold, intentional, impact-driven
philanthropy, investing in people, ideas, and ecosystems that make freedom
tangible and support human flourishing in open societies. That focus aligns with
the [OpenSats mission] to support Bitcoin and related free and open-source
software that strengthens individual sovereignty and liberty.

We are thankful to The Reynolds Foundation for placing its trust and confidence
in OpenSats, and we remain fully committed to making it count.
