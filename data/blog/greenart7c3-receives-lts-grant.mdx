OpenSats is pleased to announce long-term support for
[Greenart7c3](https://github.com/greenart7c3) for his ongoing contributions to
the nostr ecosystem. Greenart7c3 is the creator and lead developer of Citrine
and Amber.

- [Citrine](https://github.com/greenart7c3/Citrine) is an Android-based nostr relay that functions as both a local relay and
a shared database, allowing users to send and receive events while maintaining
control of their data offline.
- [Amber](https://github.com/greenart7c3/Amber) is an Android-based nostr signer using
[NIP-46](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/46.md) to enhance
private key security practices for users utilizing the same key across multiple
clients. It focuses on enhancing security by keeping sensitive keys in a single,
secure app that is responsible for remotely signing events on behalf of multiple
clients.

Both projects contribute to the broader goal of decentralizing and
safeguarding user privacy within the nostr ecosystem.

With support from this LTS grant, Greenart7c3 will focus on the continued
development of Citrine and Amber, with plans including:

- Extending Amber and Citrine to cross-platform usability beyond Android
  devices.

- Improve the user experience when using Amber and Citrine in [Amethyst](/blog/vitor-pamplona-receives-lts-grant).

- Testing integrations with web applications such as
  [Snort](/blog/kieran-receives-lts-grant) and
  [Coracle](/blog/hodlbod-receives-lts-grant), enabling them to work seamlessly
  on Android without the need for browser extensions.

- Build new and improve existing [NIP-55](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/55.md) libraries
  so developers can easily add support for external signers.
