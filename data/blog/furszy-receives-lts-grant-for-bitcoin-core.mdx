---

OpenSats is proud to welcome our newest LTS grantee, [Furszy][https://github.com/furszy]. Furszy is receiving
long-term support for his contributions to Bitcoin Core.

He joined as a Core developer in June 2022 and has been actively involved in a
wide spectrum of contributions ever since. Prior to his current role, he served
as a software maintainer for a privacy-centric project. Consequently, privacy
and performance are two of the areas Furszy focuses on.

> In many countries with internet restrictions or limited access to adequate
> hardware, individuals face significant barriers to participating in the Bitcoin
> network. My work aims to bridge this gap by enhancing the performance and
> privacy aspects of the main reference client. Even slight improvements can make
> a substantial difference in allowing more people, regardless of their
> geographical location or technical constraints, to access and benefit from the
> Bitcoin network.

Since Furszy started contributing to Bitcoin Core, he has submitted almost [90
pull requests][PRs], many of which have been merged successfully.

> Being part of Bitcoin is especially significant to me, because, as an
> Argentinian, I have witnessed and suffered a country in dire need of a
> decentralized monetary system.

Long-term support will allow Furszy to dedicate significant attention to the
project's shared goals and the stability of the main reference client. In
addition to his own code contributions, he is [actively reviewing][reviews] and
providing feedback on others' pull requests, as well as engaging in daily
discussions with other core developers to address potential issues and
collaboratively explore avenues for enhancing the project.

> I consider these activities essential for ensuring the reliability and proper
> functionality of a software as important as the Bitcoin main reference client.

In addition to improving the software's workflow performance, refining the
source code architecture, bolstering test coverage, and advocating for general
standardization efforts, he is also working on implementing new features such as
"Light Sync" mode.

The goal of "Light Sync" is to research and prototype the idea of introducing a
new synchronization mode in Bitcoin Core, which allows users to download and
synchronize only the subset of blocks containing transactions relevant to their
own addresses. This feature leverages the existing [BIP 157] and [BIP 158]
network protocols, enabling the usage of the core wallet on limited storage and
network-constrained devices, as well as in restrictive countries.
