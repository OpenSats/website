OpenSats is pleased to announce that Hodlbod has been granted long-term support
for his ongoing contributions to advancing the nostr ecosystem.

Hodlbod is the creator of [Coracle](https://coracle.social/), a web-based nostr
client focused on improving relay selection, Web-of-Trust (WoT) based
moderation, content recommendations, and privacy. It supports various NIPs to
enable features like social threads, customizable feeds, Lightning Zaps, and
multiple user accounts.

He also created [Triflector](https://github.com/coracle-social/triflector), a
nostr relay enforcing authentication via custom policies. Triflector supports
access control methods like pubkey whitelisting, dynamic policy checks, relay
claims, and group-based controls with
[NIP-87](https://github.com/coracle-social/nips/blob/groups/87.md).

In addition to his development efforts, Hodlbod co-hosts the podcasts “[Thank
God for Nostr](https://podcastindex.org/podcast/6437926)" and "[Thank God for
Bitcoin](https://podcastindex.org/podcast/6437929)," which delve into the worlds
of nostr and Bitcoin, with notable developers and contributors as frequent
guests.

With this grant, Hodlbod plans to continue enhancements of Coracle and
Triflector, while expanding his efforts across several key areas, including:

- Utilizing DVMs within clients to enable more decentralization.
- Researching ways to improve interoperability to advance nostr's growth.
- Creating special-purpose nostr relays.
- Developing and hosting services for [NIP-05](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/05.md), indexing, DVMs, relay-as-a-service, and client-as-a-service.

> Building a decentralized social media client like Coracle is not just about
> technology, but about fostering genuine community interactions and ensuring user
> privacy.
