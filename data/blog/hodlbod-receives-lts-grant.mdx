OpenSats is pleased to announce that Hodlbod has been granted long-term support
for his ongoing contributions to advancing the nostr ecosystem.

Hodlbod is the creator of [Coracle](https://coracle.social/), a web-based nostr
client focused on improving relay selection, Web-of-Trust (WoT) based
moderation, content recommendations, and privacy. Coracle has been the test bed 
for several innovations to nostr, including private groups, new-style DMs, and custom feeds.

He has also created a number of other projects, including [Triflector](https://github.com/coracle-social/triflector), a nostr relay enforcing 
authentication via custom policies; [Welshman](https://github.com/coracle-social/welshman), a library providing functionality extracted from 
Coracle; and [Keypub](https://keypub.coracle.social/), an experimental feed focused on people rather than notes.

In addition to his development efforts, Hodlbod co-hosts the podcast “[Thank
God for Nostr](https://podcastindex.org/podcast/6437926)," which delves into the world
of nostr with notable developers and contributors as frequent guests.

With this grant, Hodlbod plans to continue development of Coracle and his experimentation, focusing on certain key areas:

- Refining Coracle's user experience and releasing native versions.
- Using DVMs and special purpose relays to support more use cases in a decentralized way.
- Researching ways to improve interoperability to advance nostr's growth.
- Researching applications and implementations of web of trust to reduce spam, improve privacy, and recommend content.

> Building a decentralized social media client like Coracle is not just about
> technology, but about fostering genuine community interactions and ensuring user
> privacy.
