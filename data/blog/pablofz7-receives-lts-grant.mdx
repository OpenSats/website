We are excited to announce [PabloF7z](https://github.com/pablof7z) as our latest
LTS grantee.

Pablo is one of the most prolific developers within the Nostr community, with
notable projects like [nsecBunker](https://github.com/kind-0/nsecbunkerd), [Nostr Development
Kit (NDK)](https://github.com/nostr-dev-kit/ndk),
[Shipyard](https://shipyard.pub/), [Highlighter](https://highlighter.com/),
[Wikifreedia](https://wikifreedia.vercel.app/), and more.

Long-Term Support will allow Pablo to continue his journey through the uncharted
waters of Nostr. He will remain focused on the “other stuff” to ensure that the
protocol can live up to its vast potential. In the next months he plans to work
on niche relays, [event database
synchronization](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/29.md),
localized flows, client discoverability, and more. He will also continue to
maintain and extend NDK, making sure that one of the most crucial development
toolkits in nostr will meet the growing needs of this emerging ecosystem.

Pablo’s work has proven crucial during the initial phase of this emerging
landscape, and we hope that our long-term support will allow him to work on
freedom tech for many years to come.

Our mission at OpenSats is to provide sustainable funding for the builders and
maintainers of critical open-source infrastructure within the Bitcoin and Nostr
ecosystem.
