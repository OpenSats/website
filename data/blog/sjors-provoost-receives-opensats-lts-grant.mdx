New month, new LTS grantee! Sjors Provoost is the latest bitcoin core developer
receiving long-term support from OpenSats, after [Marco
Falke](https://opensats.org/blog/announcing-lts-grant-program-to-support-bitcoin-core-contributors)
in July and [Josi
Baker](https://opensats.org/blog/josi-baker-receives-opensats-lts-grant) in
August.

Sjors is a Physicist turned bitcoin developer and self-proclaimed shadowy
super-coder. When he is not shadowy super-coding, he is co-hosting the [Bitcoin,
Explained](https://pod.link/1532957243) podcast with Aaron van Wirdum and
writing blog posts and books, most recently [Bitcoin: A Work In
Progress](https://www.btcwip.com/).

He will continue to work in all areas of the codebase, as he has over the past
five years. While Sjors is a generalist, he intends to focus on specific areas
from time to time, such as [Stratum V2](https://opensats.org/projects/stratumv2)
integration, [AssumeUTXO](https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/assumeutxo/), and
hardware wallet support.

Sjors has reviewed almost a thousand pull requests since 2017, some of them
in-depth reviews across many rebases.[^fn-reviews] He has opened about 160 pull
requests over the years in various areas, mostly related to the wallet
codebase.[^fn-prs] His main focus is on thorough code reviews as opposed to
writing code himself, though.

Sjors has done in-depth reviews of the `guix` build system, P2P code, parts of
Taproot, `assumeutxo`, tests, and the GUI. You can follow his activity on
[GitHub](https://github.com/Sjors) and
[nostr](https://njump.me/npub1s6z7hmmx2vud66f3utxd70qem8cwtggx0jgc7gh8pqwz2k8cltuqrdwk4c).

Support for Sjors’ work is sourced from our General Fund and made possible by
generous donors like you. If you would like to support the work of Sjors and
other core developers, consider [donating to the
fund](https://opensats.org/projects/general_fund).

The OpenSats LTS program exists to provide sustainable funding for long-term
contributors to critical open-source projects. You can apply for the program
