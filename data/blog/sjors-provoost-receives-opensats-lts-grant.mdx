New month, new LTS grantee! Sjors Provoost is the latest bitcoin core developer
receiving long-term support from OpenSats, after [Marco
Falke](https://opensats.org/blog/announcing-lts-grant-program-to-support-bitcoin-core-contributors)
in July and [Josi
Baker](https://opensats.org/blog/josi-baker-receives-opensats-lts-grant) in
August.

Sjors is a Physicist turned bitcoin developer and self-proclaimed shadowy
super-coder. When he is not shadowy super-coding, he is co-hosting the [Bitcoin,
Explained](https://pod.link/1532957243) podcast with Aaron van Wirdum and
writing blog posts and books, most recently [Bitcoin: A Work In
Progress](https://www.btcwip.com/).

He will continue to work in all areas of the codebase, as he has over the past
five years. While Sjors is a generalist, he intends to focus on specific areas
from time to time, such as [Stratum V2](https://opensats.org/projects/stratumv2)
integration, [AssumeUTXO](https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/assumeutxo/), and
hardware wallet support.

Sjors has reviewed almost a thousand pull requests since 2017, some of them
in-depth reviews across many rebases.[^fn-reviews] He has opened about 160 pull
requests over the years in various areas, mostly related to the wallet
codebase.[^fn-prs] His main focus is on thorough code reviews as opposed to
writing code himself, though.

Sjors has done in-depth reviews of the `guix` build system, P2P code, parts of
Taproot, `assumeutxo`, tests, and the GUI. You can follow his activity on
[GitHub](https://github.com/Sjors) and
[nostr](https://njump.me/npub1s6z7hmmx2vud66f3utxd70qem8cwtggx0jgc7gh8pqwz2k8cltuqrdwk4c).

Support for Sjorsâ€™ work is sourced from our General Fund and made possible by
generous donors like you. If you would like to support the work of Sjors and
other core developers, consider [donating to the
fund](https://opensats.org/projects/general_fund).

The OpenSats LTS program exists to provide sustainable funding for long-term
contributors to critical open-source projects. You can apply for the program
