OpenSats is thrilled to introduce our latest LTS grantee:
[0xB10C](https://github.com/0xB10C). He builds Bitcoin network monitoring tools,
notably the Bitcoin Core tracing framework, providing detailed insights into
network activities.

His [miningpool-observer](https://miningpool.observer/) and
[peer-observer](https://github.com/0xB10C/peer-observer) projects are pivotal in
his various research pieces and observations, such as [linking bitcoin
transactions to IPs][ips] and [finding missing transactions][txs].

[txs]: https://b10c.me/observations/08-missing-sanctioned-transactions/

Our grant will further assist him in reviewing and testing Bitcoin Core PRs from
a data-driven approach, ensuring informed decision-making and validating
proposed changes with real-world testing. Additionally, it will support the
development of projects like [fork-observer](https://fork.observer/) and
[addrman-observer](https://addrman.observer/).  

The support of this grant will also help increase the visibility of his work
through his blog and observation posts. These not only raise awareness of
crucial technical considerations but also serve as a reminder to our community
that [vegans can be real bitcoiners
too](https://b10c.me/blog/010-are-you-real-bitcoiner/).

> My aim is to bring clarity and depth to the understanding of the Bitcoin
> network's complex dynamics. This is essential for maintaining the network's
> robustness and guiding community decisions.
