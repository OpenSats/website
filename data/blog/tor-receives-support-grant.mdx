OpenSats is pleased to announce a support grant for [The Tor
Project](https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/team), a nonprofit organization
dedicated to privacy and internet freedom since 2006.

Our [mission](/mission) is to provide a sustainable ecosystem of funding for
free and open-source contributors and projects, especially those that help
Bitcoin flourish. It's obvious to us that Tor is such a project.

Tor originated in the mid-1990s as a U.S. Naval Research Laboratory project to
create a secure and anonymized communications network using onion routing.
[Open-sourced in 2002](https://www.torproject.org/about/history/), this
technology led to the formation of The Tor Project, which launched the
privacy-focused [Tor Browser](https://www.torproject.org/download/) in 2008. The
Tor Project also developed tools like [Nyx](https://nyx.torproject.org/),
[Stem](https://stem.torproject.org/), and
[TorBirdy](https://gitlab.torproject.org/legacy/trac/-/wikis/torbirdy) to
enhance usability and privacy further.

The integration of the Tor network with Bitcoin has [always played a crucial
role](https://satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org/posts/bitcointalk/45/) in
safeguarding the ecosystem by increasing privacy. It allows bitcoiners to:

- **Anonymize Network Communications:** Protect IP addresses of miners, node operators, and users 
  from tracing and surveillance.

- **Run Bitcoin Infrastructure as Onion Services:** Operate nodes and other
  infrastructure as Tor [onion
  services](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Setting_up_a_Tor_hidden_service) with
  `.onion` addresses, simplifying connectivity by reducing the need for
  [NAT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation) or firewall
  setups and allowing controlled access without relying on DNS.

> We believe everyone should be able to explore the internet with privacy.
> [...] We advance human rights and defend your privacy online through free
> software and open networks.

This grant will allow The Tor Project to expand its team of [onion
service](https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/onion-services) developers, which
will be instrumental in releasing substantial improvements to onion services,
including an improved protection mechanism against [DDoS
attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack). Strengthening
this team will ensure that Tor continues to provide reliable, anonymous, and
secure communication for a global user base, including those in heavily censored
regions. This is particularly important for the Bitcoin ecosystem, as users
expose themselves to various risks if they can't connect to the Bitcoin network
in a private manner.

OpenSats is committed to supporting developers and contributors who strengthen
the open-source foundations of Bitcoin, nostr, and related technologies.

The generosity of our donors makes grants like this possible. To continue
supporting important projects like Tor, please consider donating to our [General
Fund](/funds/general).
