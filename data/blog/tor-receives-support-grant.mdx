OpenSats is pleased to announce a support grant for [The Tor
Project](https://www.torproject.org/), a nonprofit organization dedicated to
privacy and internet freedom since 2006.

Our [mission](/mission) is to provide a sustainable ecosystem of funding for
free and open-source contributors and projects, especially those that help
Bitcoin flourish. It's obvious to us that Tor is such a project.

Tor originated in the mid-1990s as a U.S. Naval Research Laboratory project to
create a secure and anonymized communications network using onion routing.
[Open-sourced in 2002](https://www.torproject.org/about/history/), this
technology led to the formation of The Tor Project, which launched the
privacy-focused [Tor Browser](https://www.torproject.org/download/) in 2008. The
Tor Project also developed tools like [Nyx](https://nyx.torproject.org/),
[Stem](https://stem.torproject.org/), and
[TorBirdy](https://gitlab.torproject.org/legacy/trac/-/wikis/torbirdy) to
enhance usability and privacy further.

The integration of the Tor network with Bitcoin has [always played a crucial
role](https://satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org/posts/bitcointalk/45/) in
safeguarding the ecosystem by increasing privacy. It allows bitcoiners to:

- **Anonymize their network communications,** effectively protecting the IP
addresses of the user from tracing and surveillance, whether it be miner, node
operator, service provider, or regular user.

- **Run infrastructure as [Onion Services][os],** massively increasing the privacy of
node runners and other infrastructure providers, as well as their users.

[os]: https://community.torproject.org/onion-services/

This grant will allow The Tor Project to expand its team of [onion service
developers](https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/onion-services), which will be
instrumental in releasing substantial improvements to onion services, including
an improved protection mechanism against DDoS attacks.  Strengthening this team
will ensure that Tor continues to provide reliable, anonymous, and secure
communication for a global user base, including those in heavily censored
regions. This is particularly important for the Bitcoin and nostr ecosystems, as
users expose themselves to various risks if they can't connect to those networks
in a private manner.

> We believe everyone should be able to explore the internet with privacy.
> [...] We advance human rights and defend your privacy online through free
> software and open networks.
