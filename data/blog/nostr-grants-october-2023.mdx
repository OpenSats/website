You know what the best thing about nostr is? It's not its simple architecture.
It's not that it has cryptographic proof baked into every action. It's not that
every note stands on its own. It's not the good vibes, the zaps, or all the
"other stuff," or the fact that it's officially called [THE
NOSTR](https://njump.me/note1gt4q3wdd6lfjzmweh9ge594s8vjga5cshuqdqzdhj9d6ahdlgasqpe96fa)
(yes, in all caps). It's that it works. And that it has worked since inception
and that it will (~~probably~~ ~~maybe~~ very likely) continue to work in the future.

And while it will continue to work, it will improve continually, as open
protocols tend to do. It becomes more obvious by the day that nostr is here to
stay, and we're going to do our best to make it the best, weirdest protocol it
can be.

We are happy to announce 12 new grants for open-source projects in the nostr
ecosystem. Adding to the [16 grants announced in
July](https://opensats.org/blog/nostr-grants-july-2023), plus the [three grants
announced in
August](https://opensats.org/blog/bitcoin-and-nostr-grants-august-2023), the
total number of nostr projects funded by OpenSats as of October is 31. [October
31](https://web.archive.org/web/20181101115634/http://www.metzdowd.com/pipermail/cryptography/2008-October/014810.html):
what a lovely coincidence!

The projects above have received grants of various durations and sizes, and we
have more nostr-related applications in the pipeline. Our financial support for
nostr projects is made possible by generous donors like you. If you would like
to contribute to the development of the nostr ecosystem, consider making a
donation to [The Nostr Fund](https://opensats.org/projects/nostr):

As always, let's spend some time to look at these projects in more detail:

## Nozzle

[Nozzle](https://github.com/dluvian/Nozzle/releases) is a lightweight Nostr
client for Android. It aims to make Nostr more decentralized by organically
discovering relays and requesting content only from those relays that really
have the posts the user is looking for. This reduces the load on relays, lowers
your data usage, and promotes the utilization of smaller relays instead of only
interacting with a few big, centralizing ones.

## Blowater

[Blowater](https://blowater.app/) is a DM client for desktop, web, and mobile.
It aims to provide the best DM experience on Nostr so far. Its long-term goal is
to replace the likes of Telegram, Slack, Discord, and similar.

## Nostur

[Nostur](https://nostur.com/) is a feature-rich nostr client for iOS that aims
to be simple to use for Mac, iPhone, and iPad users. It supports multiple
accounts, has nsecBunker support, and imposter detection features. Nostur is
opinionated in its
[mission](https://njump.me/naddr1qq8xummnw36hyttdd9ehx6t0dcq3gamnwvaz7tmjv4kxz7fwv3sk6atn9e5k7q3qn0sturny6w9zn2wwexju3m6asu7zh7jnv2jt2kx6tlmfhs7thq0qxpqqqp65w8jxczy)
and uses Apple-native features such as iCloud to onboard as many users to nostr
as possible. You can find a complete [feature list](https://nostur.com/) as well
as an installation link on [nostur.com](https://nostur.com/).

## Nostrocket

Nostrocket is a new economic tool that uses Bitcoin and Nostr to create
leaderless, location-independent economies that reward productive solutions to
shared problems. Technically speaking, a Nostrocket client is a state machine.
Different parts of the state machine can run in different places, e.g., much of
the state can be rebuilt directly in the browser, but computationally heavy
operations like indexing a large number of nostr events or validating the
Bitcoin blockchain (some parts of the protocol also require knowledge of the
current state of Bitcoin) are better done closer to the metal.

## snort.social

Snort is a web client with the goal of making nostr's features accessible in a
user-friendly manner while maintaining its censorship-resistant properties.
Snort's primary focus is to support a wide variety of features that showcase the
power of the nostr network while remaining a clean and performant client.

## zap.stream

[Zap.stream](https://zap.stream/) is a live streaming nostr client PWA that
allows people to interact with externally hosted HLS streams. Users can chat,
zap, and react to the stream while watching a live stream. The goal of the
project is to create a nostr alternative to [twitch.tv](https://www.twitch.tv/)
and similar online streaming platforms.

## algia

Algia is a CLI client that can manipulate nostr operations such as post, like,
boost, delete, as well as streams. Algia can handle JSON, so you can easily
create nostr bots with external tools such as `jq`.

Repository: https://github.com/mattn/algia  
License: MIT

## nostr.watch

[nostr.watch](https://nostr.watch/) aims to be an authoritative source for nostr
relay data. It aggregates data on nostr relays (and the network in general) to
assist users, developers, and relay operators. The application is a
client-side-first application that can be run locally without any additional
architecture.

Repository: https://github.com/dskvr/nostr-watch  
License: MIT

## relay.tools

[Relay.tools](https://relay.tools/) is a web-based control panel and deployment
system for nostr relays. Its goal is to enable the entire nostr population to
create relays and manage them, even those with no prior systems knowledge. The
web UI provides easy relay creation, moderation capabilities, spam prevention,
filtering rules, and best practice settings. It does not rely on any cloud
provider and is 100% free from vendor lock-in.

Repository: https://github.com/relaytools  
License: GPL-3.0

## Nostree

[Nostree](https://nostree.me/) is a nostr micro-app to create, manage, share,
and explore links and reference lists (as well as show notes and other stuff).
The idea is that it becomes a good presentation card for you and a place to
discover nostr & the wider internet in a more accessible way.

Repository: https://github.com/gzuuus/linktr-nostr  
License: GPL-3.0

## ONOSENDAI

[ONOSENDAI](https://www.onosendai.tech/) is an experimental nostr client that
maps and visualizes the nostr protocol in a 3D space. The goal of ONOSENDAI is
to be the reference implementation of a novel [cyberspace
protocol](https://github.com/arkin0x/cyberspace/), a digital reality that,
thanks to Bitcoin and nostr, stands on its own. You can play around with an
early version of the client at [onosendai.tech](https://www.onosendai.tech/).

## 0xchat

0xchat is a secure chat client for iOS and Android built on top of the nostr
protocol. It prioritizes privacy and offers encrypted private chats & contacts,
as well as multiple DM types: normal, sealed, and secret. The client offers
audio and video calling capabilities between contacts, using Nostr relays as a
signaling mechanism. The actual audio and video calls are facilitated via ICE
servers, and users are free to select their own ICE servers if preferred. In the
future, the client will support multi-person voice and video chats, expanding
the communication possibilities of nostriches worldwide.

In short: Nostr is not fucking leaving, and neither are we.
