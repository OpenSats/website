OpenSats is delighted to announce that [Yuki
Kishimoto](https://github.com/yukibtc) has been awarded long-term support for
his outstanding contributions to the nostr ecosystem.

Yuki is the maintainer and creator of
[rust-nostr](https://github.com/rust-nostr/nostr), a Rust implementation of the
[nostr protocol](https://github.com/rust-nostr/nostr/tree/master/crates/nostr).
This project includes a [high-level nostr client
library](https://github.com/rust-nostr/nostr/tree/master/crates/nostr-sdk),
language bindings, and more. The goal of `rust-nostr` is to broaden the reach of
the nostr protocol by enabling others to build fast, stable, and efficient nostr
applications.

Yuki's dedication to the space goes beyond `rust-nostr`. He has made significant
contributions to other projects such as
[SmartVaults](https://github.com/smartvaults/smartvaults),
[KeeChain](https://github.com/yukibtc/keechain),
[rust-negentropy](https://github.com/yukibtc/rust-negentropy),
[CDK](https://github.com/cashubtc/cdk),
[BDK](https://github.com/bitcoindevkit/bdk), and
[Mostro](https://github.com/MostroP2P/mostro).

With help from this grant, Yuki intends to continue improving and expanding
[rust-nostr](https://github.com/rust-nostr/nostr), by focusing on the following:

- Implementing the outbox model
- Bringing `rust-nostr` out of alpha and into beta status
- Extending the project by adding additional libraries
- Improving unit tests and completing additional bindings
- Implementing any missing and future [NIPs](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips)
- Writing additional code documentation and finalizing the [Rust Nostr Book](https://rust-nostr.org/)

> My goal is to empower individuals to create high-performance, stable, efficient
> and memory-safe applications in whichever language and environment they
> prefer.
