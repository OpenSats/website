As Bitcoin is approaching its next halving event, developers all over the world
are working tirelessly to bring about a better future promised by sound and
permissionless money. We are trying our best to help bring said future about by
providing no-strings-attached funding for the most impactful open-source
projects in the Bitcoin ecosystem, and we are planning to do this for many
[more](/blog/recurring-donations-from-bitwise-bitcoin-etf-bitb)
[decades](/blog/bitcoin-infrastructure-this-decade) to come.

Our board has selected eight more projects for funding. In no particular order,
here they are:

- [Splicing in LDK](#splicing-in-ldk)
- [Bitcoin Core Testing Suite](#bitcoin-core-testing-suite)
- [BLAST](#blast)
- [Scaling Lightning](#scaling-lightning)
- [Satsigner](#satsigner)
- [The Bitaxe](#the-bitaxe)
- [The Bitcoin LARP Game](#the-bitcoin-larp-game)
- [Braidpool](#braidpool)

All of the above grants are sourced from our [General
Fund](/projects/general_fund), which is funded by generous
donors like you. If you want to help us support free and open-source projects
please consider donating to the fund:

This marks the fourth wave of grants given to bitcoin projects, following our
announcements in [July](/blog/bitcoin-grants-july-2023),
[August](/blog/bitcoin-and-nostr-grants-august-2023), and
[December](/blog/bitcoin-grants-december-2023). In case
you’re interested in the types of projects and people we support, we encourage
you to have a look at our [long-term support
grants](/tags/lts) as well as our [year in
review](/blog/2023-year-in-review).

As always, let's take a closer look at the projects to understand what they are
about and how they align with [our mission](/mission).

### Splicing in LDK

Splicing is a Lightning improvement that brings several practical advantages to
users and node operators alike, such as more flexible channel management options
with lower fees & no downtime. It also allows for better experiences when it
comes to using wallets that combine on-chain and lightning payments. The goal of
`ldk-splicing` is to add splicing support to LDK in an interoperable and
pragmatic way.

### Bitcoin Core Testing Suite

The Bitcoin Core Testing Suite aims to increase the coverage and robustness of
Bitcoin Core’s testing suite. This will help increase the stability and
reliability of the bitcoin-core software and help give developers confidence
when working on improvements.

### BLAST

The “Big Lightning Automated Simulation Tool” (BLAST) is a modeling and
simulation framework specifically designed for the Lightning Network. Acting as
both a software library and a standalone tool, BLAST aims to facilitate the
creation of accurate tests and simulations that replicate real-world Lightning
Network behavior.

The primary objective of this project is to conduct research and development to
devise an efficient representation of nodes and channels. This representation
will enable the modeling of large networks while offering flexibility to
customize necessary assumptions.

### Scaling Lightning

Scaling Lightning is a framework for creating and interacting with test
lightning networks. The project aims to provide a realistic lightning network
environment for developers to build and develop their applications and services.
Similar in concept to testnet faucets, `scaling-lightning` is a great tool for
experimentation and learning.

A lot of the work is now being integrated into `warnet`, a monitoring
tool that analyzes the emergent behavior of Bitcoin networks.

### Satsigner

Satsigner is a mobile wallet that aims to give the user full control and
visibility over what is happening to their sats at the protocol level. Most
bitcoin wallets in use today use traditional designs and patterns that hide the
underlying mechanics of the bitcoin protocol. While this trade-off might be
appropriate for new users, failing to equip users with more meaningful and
in-depth interfaces can hinder the acquisition of a deeper understanding of
bitcoin. By focusing on the user experience problems from a bitcoiner’s
perspective, the project hopes to develop native solutions for UTXO, fee,
multisig, and key management.

### The Bitaxe

The Bitaxe is the first ASIC bitcoin miner in nearly a decade with fully
open-source hardware and firmware. The primary goal is to be a reference design
that can be taken as is, scaled up, and/or adapted to solve specific bitcoin
mining use cases. The design takes into consideration cost and ease of access to
core components while remaining a competitive miner.

Documentation on how to manufacture the device, program the firmware, and
contribute is central to the project.

### The Bitcoin LARP Game

The world-famous Bitcoin LARP is a game designed to understand the inner
workings of Bitcoin in a fun and interactive way. The goal of this project is to
have open-source kits available to anyone that are easy to replicate, use, and
set up.

Beyond just software and optimizing for the ability to make kits easy to build &
distribute, all instructions and build kit information will be made available
under permissive open-source licenses too.

### Braidpool

Braidpool is a decentralized bitcoin mining pool. Braidpool aims to ship an
implementation working on signet with hashrate donated by interested miners. The
project will also publish their specifications and engage the mining community
for wider adoption of Braidpool.

The Braidpool proposal builds upon Schnorr signatures and Taproot, as well as
novel peer-to-peer research. Braidpool enables all miners to do their own block
construction and miner payouts can not be blocked by a central authority like a
pool operator.

We are evaluating applications based on carefully [defined
criteria](/apply#criteria) and we do our best to select only
the [most impactful](/selection) and promising proposals.

Thank you for your continual and generous support. As we don't take a cut from
donations to open-source projects, we couldn't be doing what we are doing
without your help. If you want to help us cover our operational expenses, please
consider donating to our [operations
budget](/projects/opensats_operations_budget).

<i>Update: the original announcement listed one additional project which was
later removed due to concerns regarding the quality and feasibility of the
project. As mentioned in our <a href="/selection">grant selection process</a>,
we monitor progress closely to ensure that every grant is achieving the intended
outcomes and that the grantee is using funds responsibly. We reserve the right
to pause or cancel grants at any time, if a certain level of quality or mission
alignment is not met.</i>
