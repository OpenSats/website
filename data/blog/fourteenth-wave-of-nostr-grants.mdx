summary: "OpenSats is funding five more open-source projects advancing the nostr ecosystem."
---

We're pleased to announce a new wave of grants supporting contributors building
open-source software for the nostr ecosystem. This wave of grants includes work
on relays, developer libraries, as well as clients and services people use to
publish and consume content via nostr.

Three new grants support projects focused on improving relay access and
feed-based reading, expanding cross-platform developer tooling, and supporting a
full-featured client that continues to invest in usability and discovery. We're
also renewing support for two previous grantees, as per below.

The first-time grants in this wave will go to:

- [Nostr Feedz](#nostr-feedz)
- [Quartz](#quartz)
- [YakiHonne](#yakihonne)

The grant renewals have been awarded to:

- Dart NDK ([Aug. 2024])
- Mattn for [nostr-relay] ([Oct. 2023])

This support is made possible by donors who believe in an open,
censorship-resistant communications layer for the internet, and the builders who
are making that a reality.

Our nostr grants are sourced from [The Nostr Fund]. To help us support the nostr
ecosystem, please consider making a donation.

Let's dive in to learn about how each project is contributing to the future of
nostr.

### Nostr Feedz

[Nostr Feedz] is a web app that lets users follow traditional RSS feeds
alongside nostr long-form content ([NIP-23]), with a public guide/directory for
discovering writers. Nostr Feedz also provides a "nostr to RSS" feature that
turns nostr long-form posts into an RSS feed, so those updates can be followed
in standard RSS readers outside nostr.

The author of Nostr Feedz, [PlebOne], also maintains a self-hostable relay
project and runs a community instance at [relay.pleb.one]. It uses invite-only
Web-of-Trust access and an admin dashboard for managing invites, similar to
fiatjaf's [pyramid] and utxo's [WoT Relay].

With support from this grant, PlebOne will keep building out Nostr Feedz and the
relay project—shipping improvements, strengthening reliability, and maturing
both into stable production services. Funding also contributes to ongoing
maintenance and operational costs of the public instances.

### Quartz

Quartz is a Kotlin Multiplatform ([KMP]) library that implements nostr
functionality in a form that can be reused across other projects. It is
developed alongside [Amethyst] and is already used in production. Related work
has also included experiments integrating nostr feeds and nostr-adjacent content
into existing readers and podcast applications, helping developers understand
what it takes to bring nostr content into other applications.

With support from this grant, the Quartz project plans to complete the remaining
refactoring needed to move Android-specific code into shared multiplatform
modules, then add functionality and tests to ensure the library behaves
consistently. A final milestone is to build a simple first version of Amethyst
for iOS that can connect to nostr and do the basics, like reading and posting.

### YakiHonne

YakiHonne is a nostr client available on [web], [iOS], [Android], and
[Zapstore], built for a fast, straightforward experience with relay discovery
and publishing controls. It includes a creator portal for long-form writing,
where users can manage both drafts and published posts from a single dashboard.
The project has been in active development, and the team has iterated on
onboarding and discovery, refined UI/UX and performance characteristics, and
implemented features like outbox-style relay publishing and Web of Trust
mechanisms.

With support from this grant, YakiHonne will continue improving reliability and
user experience across devices, with particular attention to mobile stability.
Planned work includes offline-first publishing with queued delivery, media
improvements, mobile parity features such as NsecBunker integration, and
expanded payment support, including Cashu and Nutzaps ([NIP-60], [NIP-61]). The
team also plans to invest in better relay-based feeds for discovery and to
explore relay-level paid feeds designed to remain interoperable across clients.

The projects in this wave reflect the steady work that turns nostr into software
people can depend on. From relay infrastructure and feed-based tools to shared
libraries and full-featured clients, each grant supports practical improvements
that help the ecosystem remain reliable, interoperable, and easier to use.

We're grateful to our donors who make this funding possible. If you'd like to
help us continue supporting builders in the nostr ecosystem, please consider
donating to [The Nostr Fund] or becoming a recurring supporter.
