summary: "OpenSats is funding five more open-source projects advancing the nostr ecosystem."
---

We're pleased to announce a new wave of grants supporting contributors building
open-source software for the nostr ecosystem. This work includes relays,
developer libraries, and the clients and services people use to publish and
consume content over nostr.

This wave includes three new grants and two renewals. The new grants support
projects focused on improving relay access and feed-based reading, expanding
cross-platform developer tooling, and supporting a full-featured client that
continues to invest in usability and discovery. We're also renewing support for
projects that have become foundational pieces of nostr infrastructure, where
continued maintenance and incremental improvements remain important.

The first-time grants in this wave will go to:

- [Nostr Feedz and PlebOne Relay]
- [Quartz]
- [YakiHonne]

The grant renewals have been awarded to:

- Dart NDK ([Aug. 2024])
- Mattn for [nostr-relay] ([Oct. 2023])

This support is made possible by donors who believe in an open,
censorship-resistant communications layer for the internet, and the builders who
are making that a reality.

Our nostr grants are sourced from [The Nostr Fund]. To help us support the nostr
ecosystem, please consider making a donation.

Let's dive in to learn about how each project is contributing to the future of
nostr.

### Nostr Feedz and PlebOne Relay

[PlebOne] is building two nostr services that aim to improve publishing and
reading on nostr. PlebOne Relay ([relay.pleb.one]) is a whitelist-based relay
where only approved users can publish, paired with a dashboard for managing
access and invites. [Nostr Feedz] is a web app that lets users follow
traditional RSS feeds alongside nostr long-form content ([NIP-23]), with a
public guide/directory for discovering writers. Nostr Feedz also provides a
"nostr to RSS" feature that turns nostr long-form posts into an RSS feed, so
those updates can be followed in standard RSS readers outside nostr.

With support from this grant, PlebOne intends to run PlebOne Relay and Nostr
Feedz on reliable VPS infrastructure and bring both services into a stable,
public-facing production state. The funding is expected to cover initial hosting
and operational costs, with the capacity to scale if usage grows.

### Quartz

Quartz is a Kotlin Multiplatform ([KMP]) library that implements nostr
functionality in a form that can be reused across other projects. It is
developed alongside [Amethyst] and is already used in production. Related work
has also included experiments integrating nostr feeds and nostr-adjacent content
into existing readers and podcast applications, helping developers understand
what it takes to bring nostr content into other applications.

With support from this grant, the Quartz project plans to complete the remaining
refactoring needed to move Android-specific code into shared multiplatform
modules, then add functionality and tests to ensure the library behaves
consistently. A final milestone is to build a simple first version of Amethyst
for iOS that can connect to nostr and do the basics, like reading and posting.

### YakiHonne

YakiHonne is a nostr client available on [web], [iOS], [Android], and
[Zapstore], built for a fast, straightforward experience with relay discovery
and publishing controls. It includes a creator portal for long-form writing,
where users can manage both drafts and published posts from a single dashboard.
The project has been in active development, and the team has iterated on
onboarding and discovery, refined UI/UX and performance characteristics, and
implemented features like outbox-style relay publishing and Web of Trust
mechanisms.

With support from this grant, YakiHonne will continue improving reliability and
user experience across devices, with particular attention to mobile stability.
Planned work includes offline-first publishing with queued delivery, media
improvements, mobile parity features such as NsecBunker integration, and
expanded payment support, including Cashu and Nutzaps ([NIP-60], [NIP-61]). The
team also plans to invest in better relay-based feeds for discovery and to
explore relay-level paid feeds designed to remain interoperable across clients.

The projects in this wave reflect the steady work that turns nostr into software
people can depend on. From relay infrastructure and feed-based tools to shared
libraries and full-featured clients, each grant supports practical improvements
that help the ecosystem remain reliable, interoperable, and easier to use.

We're grateful to our donors who make this funding possible. If you'd like to
help us continue supporting builders in the nostr ecosystem, please consider
donating to [The Nostr Fund] or becoming a recurring supporter.
