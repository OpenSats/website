OpenSats is proud to provide long-term support for [Will
Clark](https://github.com/willcl-ark). Will is a
[Chaincode](https://chaincode.com/) alumnus and
[BTrust](https://builders.btrust.tech/) (formerly Qala) mentor who has been
contributing to Bitcoin Core for several years.

His main focus areas are issue and PR triage, [contributing fixes][PRs] for
issues and [PR review][reviews], as well as user support and communication. His
onboarding to the Bitcoin Core development process has led to the creation of
[BitcoinCore Academy](https://bitcoincore.academy/), a developer guide that
explains how to get started with contributing to Bitcoin Core, the software's
lifecycle and development workflow, technical architecture & design principles,
as well as various developer guidelines.

Since his onboarding to Bitcoin development, he has been systematically
addressing both old and new issues, ensuring they are accurately diagnosed,
resolved, or closed as necessary. This often includes reproducing reported
issues, implementing or evaluating potential fixes, and reviewing open pull
requests from other contributors.

In addition to his work on Bitcoin Core, Will has also been pivotal in the
creation of [Warnet](https://github.com/bitcoin-dev-project/warnet), a tool that
helps to monitor and analyze the emergent behaviors of Bitcoin networks. It is
part of [The Bitcoin Development
Project](https://github.com/bitcoin-dev-project/) suite of tools which is being
created to make building on and contributing to Bitcoin easier.

The OpenSats [Long-Term Support
program](/blog/announcing-lts-grant-program-to-support-bitcoin-core-contributors)
is made possible by generous donors like you. If you want to help support Will
