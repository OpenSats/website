summary: "OpenSats is funding five more open-source projects in the nostr ecosystem."
---

We're thrilled to announce our latest wave of funding, which will support five
innovative projects that advance and strengthen the nostr ecosystem.  These
projects aim to improve financial tools, localization, user experience, content
personalization, and accessibility within the nostr network.

Each project showcases the creativity and dedication driving open-source
development in nostr and reflects a shared vision for a more decentralized
future.

The five projects in this funding wave are:

- [AlgoRelay](#algorelay)
- [Pokey](#pokey)
- [Nostr Safebox](#nostr-safebox)
- [Persian NIPs](#persian-nips)
- [LumiLumi](#lumilumi)

Our support for nostr is made possible by generous donors like you. If you would
like to help us continue supporting the nostr ecosystem, consider donating to
[The Nostr Fund](/funds/nostr):

Let's look closer at the projects receiving grants and how they align with [our
mission](/mission).

### AlgoRelay

AlgoRelay is the first algorithmic relay on nostr, designed to provide
personalized feeds while maintaining transparency and user control. Unlike
proprietary solutions, AlgoRelay supports multiple clients and encourages a
diverse ecosystem of algorithms for creating engaging social feeds. Features
include dynamic "fresh feeds," sentiment-based ranking, and tools for new users
to gain visibility.

The project's roadmap includes customizability, scalability, and optimization,
with plans for a user control portal to enable customization of algorithmic
weights and preferences.

### Pokey

Pokey is a versatile Android app enhancing the nostr ecosystem with features
like multi-account support, efficient notifications, and offline Bluetooth mesh
networking. It aims to improve user experiences while enabling resilient
communication in environments with restricted internet access, particularly
where human rights are under attack.

The project is developing a basic
[BLE](https://web.archive.org/web/20170310111443/https://www.bluetooth.com/what-is-bluetooth-technology/how-it-works/low-energy)\-based
nostr mesh prototype for local communication and synchronization. Future
milestones include reducing battery consumption, refining notification handling,
and building an alpha version of the mesh app for extreme situations.

### Nostr Safebox

Nostr Safebox is an open-source wallet designed to enhance financial sovereignty
on the nostr network. Inspired by
[NIP-60](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/60.md), it stores
Cashu tokens as encrypted events on relays, allowing users to manage and
transfer funds securely. The project eliminates reliance on centralized
databases, providing a trust-minimized and platform-independent architecture.
Its ultimate goal is to empower users with a decentralized payment system that
can scale.

The current phase focuses on building a stable Python prototype, including CLI
utilities and cross-platform binaries, while integrating Safebox with Lightning
payment services like OpenBalance. Plans involve
developing multiple implementations (e.g., in Go and Rust) and refining
usability for broader adoption.

### Persian NIPs

Persian NIPs is an open-source ebook designed to provide Persian/Farsi speakers
with localized resources on nostr. It includes translations of key NIPs, user
guides for nostr tools like
[NIP-05](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/05.md), Lightning,
and developer documentation for creating and managing nostr relays and clients.
By breaking down language barriers, the project aims to bring decentralized
technology to millions of Persian/Farsi speakers worldwide.

The project plans to regularly update translations, complete a user guide, and
initiate a developer guide. Future goals include expanding contributions,
publishing physical editions, and increasing community awareness.

### LumiLumi

LumiLumi is a lightweight web client for nostr, designed to improve
accessibility and usability. It offers features like custom emoji support, relay
configuration, NIP-05 verification, and settings to reduce communication costs,
making it ideal for users in data-limited environments. Users can disable
images, icons, and OGP data for a streamlined experience, while tools like
muting and reactions enhance usability.

The roadmap includes securing a domain, listing on `njump.me`, and developing
new tools to address gaps in the nostr ecosystem.
