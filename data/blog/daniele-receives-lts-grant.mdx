OpenSats is pleased to announce that [Daniele](https://github.com/dtonon) is
joining our roster of long-term support grantees for his contributions to the
nostr ecosystem.

Daniele's experience in ecommerce development, expertise in UI/UX design, and
deep understanding of the [outbox
model](https://highscalability.com/gossip-protocol-explained/) has made him a
key contributor in improving accessibility, usability, and scalability for users
across different platforms. He has contributed to several nostr projects,
including [Gossip](https://github.com/mikedilger/gossip#) and
[Coracle](https://coracle.social/).

Beyond these efforts, Daniele is contributing to a variety of other nostr
projects, including [Njump](https://github.com/dtonon/njump),
[go-nostr](https://github.com/nbd-wtf/go-nostr), and
[nostr-ruby](https://github.com/dtonon/nostr-ruby).

He is also involved in the [Nostr Design initiative](https://nostrdesign.org/),
which provides comprehensive guidance to help developers enhance the user
experience across nostr projects.

With the support of this grant, Daniele will focus on:

- Refining  Gossip's onboarding process,
- Exploring new applications of the outbox model,
- Developing marketplace-related NIPs, and
- Ongoing enhancement of Coracle, focusing on accessibility and usability.

Our mission at OpenSats is to provide sustainable funding for the builders and
maintainers of critical FOSS infrastructure within the Bitcoin and nostr
ecosystem.

The [LTS program](/blog/nostr-lts-long-term-support-for-nostr-developers) is
made possible by the generosity of our donors. To continue supporting
contributors like Daniele, consider donating to [The Nostr Fund](/funds/nostr).
