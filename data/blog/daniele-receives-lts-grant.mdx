OpenSats is pleased to announce that [Daniele](https://github.com/dtonon) is
joining our roster of long-term support grantees for his contributions to the
Nostr ecosystem.

Daniele's experience in ecommerce development, expertise in UI/UX design, and
deep understanding of the Nostr paradigm, has made him a key contributor in
improving accessibility, usability, and scalability for users across different
platforms.
He has contributed to several nostr projects, including
[Gossip](https://github.com/mikedilger/gossip),
[Coracle](https://coracle.social/), [Njump](https://github.com/dtonon/njump),
[Oracolo](https://github.com/dtonon/oracolo),
[go-nostr](https://github.com/nbd-wtf/go-nostr),
[nostr-ruby](https://github.com/dtonon/nostr-ruby), and
[window.nostr.js](https://github.com/fiatjaf/window.nostr.js).

He is also involved in the [Nostr Design initiative](https://nostrdesign.org/),
which provides comprehensive guidance to help developers enhance the user
experience across Nostr projects.

With the support of this grant, Daniele will focus on:

- Refining Gossip's and Coracle's user experience, focusing on accessibility and
  usability,
- Exploring new applications around groups and communities,
- Developing marketplace-related NIPs and supporting related apps, and
- Building a new sign-up paradigm/tool to facilitate the onboarding process.
