OpenSats is pleased to announce a new wave of grants supporting six projects
advancing the Bitcoin ecosystem.

This round includes three first-time project grants—each showcasing promising
developments in self-custody, Lightning-based financial tools, and developer
sustainability. Additionally, we're renewing our commitment to three existing
project grants that continue to push the boundaries of decentralized
infrastructure and secure bitcoin usage.

The three first-time project grants in this wave are:

- [Bitcoin Safe](#bitcoin-safe)
- [Stable Channels](#stable-channels)
- [Waye](#waye)

In addition to the above, OpenSats has renewed project grants for:

- [Floresta](/blog/bitcoin-grants-september-2024-7th-wave#floresta)
- [Krux](/blog/bitcoin-grants-july-2024#krux)
- [Krux-Installer](/blog/bitcoin-grants-july-2024#krux-installer)

Thanks to the generosity of our donors, OpenSats can actively support the
open-source developers and projects that are building key infrastructure
and helping bitcoin flourish.

Let's explore these projects in more detail to understand their goals,
contributions, and their role in strengthening the Bitcoin ecosystem.

### Bitcoin Safe

[Bitcoin Safe](https://bitcoin-safe.org/en/) is an open-source, self-sovereign
bitcoin wallet designed for secure and intuitive self-custody. By integrating
[BDK](https://bitcoindevkit.org/), [nostr], and Compact Block Filters ([BIP 158]),
it enhances privacy and reliability while reducing reliance on centralized
servers. Currently in beta, Bitcoin Safe streamlines self-custody by simplifying
single- and multi-signature storage, drawing inspiration from Electrum, Sparrow,
and mempool.space.

One of Bitcoin Safe's standout features is "Sync & Chat", a nostr-based
messaging system that leverages relays to route encrypted messages and
metadata between users and devices. Whenever a Bitcoin Safe wallet sends a
[PBST](https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/psbt/) to another Bitcoin Safe wallet,
the transaction labels are synced between devices, and when multi-sig users
message each other concerning the status of their transaction, all of this
encrypted communication is securely relayed over nostr.

Next steps for Bitcoin Safe include refining the "Sync & Chat" feature by
improving nostr relay reliability, transitioning to [`bdk_wallet v1.1.0`] for
improved performance and privacy, and implementing deterministic builds for
Windows and Linux.

### Stable Channels

[Stable Channels](https://stablechannels.com/) is an open-source project
introducing bitcoin-backed dollar balances to the Lightning Network, enabling
decentralized, self-custodial stable value transactions without relying on
centralized stablecoins. By matching users seeking stable USD exposure with
those desiring leveraged bitcoin positions, Stable Channels facilitates
synthetic dollar balances through frequent, price-adjusted settlements over
Lightning payment channels. This approach maintains dollar-pegged stability for
one party while providing leveraged bitcoin exposure for the counterparty. The
project has also collaborated with [Cashu](https://docs.cashu.space/protocol) to
integrate its stability mechanism into eCash mints, allowing users to mint USD
and EUR tokens backed by bitcoin.

Looking ahead, Stable Channels will continue developing its Rust-based reference
implementation using [LDK](https://lightningdevkit.org/) and
[BDK](https://bitcoindevkit.org/), ensuring compatibility across server,
desktop, and mobile platforms. Key milestones include deploying an iOS app for
interacting with custom LSPs, launching an alpha version in early 2025, and
refining the software based on user feedback. The project also plans to release
a stable version across all platforms and develop a decentralized marketplace
using [Liquidity Ads], further enhancing Bitcoin's Lightning Network with
self-custodial, stable financial tools.

### Waye

[Waye](https://www.waye.dev/) is an initiative dedicated to supporting the
well-being of developers building open-source technologies, aiming to reduce
burnout and improve the long-term sustainability of their work. Recognizing the
unique challenges faced by grant-funded, unaffiliated open-source developers—who
often juggle engineering, project management, and community roles—Waye has
launched pilot programs to address these issues. These
[initiatives](https://www.waye.dev/initiatives) include academic research, group
coaching, and the development of scalable, openly shared frameworks.

At the heart of their mission is [OS
Reboot](https://www.waye.dev/initiatives/os-reboot#bitcoin), Waye's cornerstone program,
with monthly expert-led discussions, structured group work, and reflection
periods to provide sustained, practical support for open-source developers. The
outcomes of Waye initiatives will be open-sourced, providing the broader
community with methodologies and frameworks to better support FOSS contributors.
By fostering a more resilient and diverse developer community, Waye aims to
strengthen the human infrastructure essential for advancing decentralized
technologies. If you are an open-source developer looking for support, sign up for a program or [reach out to Waye directly](mailto:waye.dev@gmail.com).

Bitcoin's strength lies in its open, permissionless nature—sustaining that
requires continued support for free and open-source development. Thanks to the
generosity of our donors, OpenSats can fund builders like those featured here,
working to make Bitcoin more secure, decentralized, and accessible.

If you'd like to support open-source development, consider making a donation.
Every contribution helps sustain the people and projects shaping Bitcoin's
future.
