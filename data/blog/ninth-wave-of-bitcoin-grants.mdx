summary: "OpenSats is funding four more open-source projects in the Bitcoin ecosystem."
---

We are pleased to announce the ninth wave of grants from our General Fund,
supporting a new selection of projects that enhance open-source innovation,
privacy, and accessibility within the Bitcoin ecosystem. This round features a
range of initiatives, each offering unique contributions to Bitcoin's
development and practical applications.

These projects embody a shared focus on decentralization, transparency, and user
empowerment, addressing important challenges and driving meaningful progress in
the ecosystem.

The four project grants in this wave are:

- [Kibo](#kibo)
- [El Tor](#el-tor)
- [Nutstash](#nutstash)
- [rust-bitcoin](#rust-bitcoin)

Thanks to the generosity of our donors, we are able to fund projects that push
the boundaries of what's possible while addressing key priorities in Bitcoin's
development. If you want to join us in supporting projects like the above,

Let's take a closer look at these projects to discover their purpose, impact,
and the value they bring to the Bitcoin ecosystem.

### Kibo

[Kibo] is a Bitcoin-only on-chain data generator and
visualizer that is free, open-source, verifiable, local-first, and
self-hostable. It complements tools like [mempool.space](https://mempool.space/)
by offering a global/macro view of network dynamics rather than a
micro/address-level view. Kibo provides a real-time API with thousands of routes
and a robust application interface, promoting transparency and trust in the
Bitcoin network for researchers, developers, and enthusiasts.

Kibo aims to continue refining its application by improving performance,
enhancing user experience, and adding new datasets and charts. Planned features
include smoother chart displays for block-height data, custom dashboards, and
integrations like nostr for storing user preferences. In the long-term, Kibo
envisions expanding its offerings to include underappreciated on-chain data and
novel use cases to make the network more accessible and verifiable.

### El Tor

[El Tor](https://devpost.com/software/el-tor) is a high-bandwidth Tor network
fork incentivized by the Bitcoin Lightning Network. By enabling users to host
relays and earn sats for sharing bandwidth, El Tor addresses existing
limitations of the Tor network while supporting anonymous communication. The
project enhances censorship resistance and facilitates private interactions for
services like ecash mints, nostr relays, and Bitcoin node communication.

El Tor plans to expand the network's scale and capabilities by onboarding more
relays globally and leveraging financial incentives to drive adoption. This
effort will support greater bandwidth, reliability, and anonymity for users, and
aims to provide a sustainable model for future development. The project will continue
refining its codebase and exploring integrations that bring the vision of
private, decentralized communication closer to reality.

### Nutstash

[Nutstash](https://www.nutstash.app/) is a multi-platform Cashu ecash wallet
with integrated Lightning and nostr functionality. It enables secure and private
bitcoin transactions through features like full wallet encryption, mint
discovery, nostr-wallet-connect, and recovery from seed. Nutstash simplifies
ecash payments and provides a privacy-focused solution for making bitcoin
transactions more accessible and practical for everyday use.

Nutstash intends to implement additional features such as offline token
verification and Cashu payment requests, aligning with recent protocol updates.
The project will prioritize bug fixes, integrate blinded authentication for
community mints, and explore on-chain mint functionality using [BOLT
12](https://github.com/lightning/bolts/blob/master/12-offer-encoding.md). These
enhancements aim to make Nutstash a comprehensive and reliable tool for ecash
transactions in the Bitcoin ecosystem.

### rust-bitcoin

`rust-bitcoin` is a low-level Bitcoin library written in Rust that allows
applications to interact with the Bitcoin network. It serves as a foundational
tool for projects like Bitcoin Dev Kit (BDK) and Lightning Dev Kit (LDK),
offering reliability and correctness essential for developers building on these
frameworks. The library also supports language bindings, enabling developers
from various ecosystems to leverage its capabilities.

The project's focus is on stabilizing core components and releasing version 1.0
of key crates such as `hex-conservative`, `bitcoin_hashes`, `bitcoin_io`,
`bitcoin_units`, and `bitcoin_primitives`. These efforts aim to provide stable
APIs for projects like [BDK](https://github.com/bitcoindevkit#hey-there-) and
[LDK](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/.github/blob/main/profile/README.md#hey-there-),
empowering developers to confidently build on a collaborative, clean platform.
