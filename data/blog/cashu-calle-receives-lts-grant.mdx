---

OpenSats is thrilled to announce long-term support for our latest grantee,
[Calle](https://github.com/callebtc).

Calle is recognized for his ongoing work with [Cashu](https://cashu.space/), a
free and open-source Chaumian Ecash protocol that greatly improves user
transaction privacy and efficiency. He has also been instrumental in the
development and maintenance of the popular mint implementation,
[Nutshell](https://github.com/cashubtc/nutshell), and the
[Cashu.me](http://cashu.me) wallet, which supports offline Ecash transactions.

In addition to his work with Cashu, Calle has contributed to other notable
projects such as [LNbits](https://github.com/lnbits/lnbits),
[LightningTipBot](https://github.com/LightningTipBot/LightningTipBot),
[Electronwall](https://github.com/callebtc/electronwall), and various other
Lightning tools and libraries. These projects demonstrate Calle's commitment to
enhancing the functionality and user experience within the Bitcoin ecosystem.

This LTS grant will support Calle's efforts to further enhance the robustness
and performance of the Cashu protocol. Some of his key initiatives will include
the introduction of a fee structure to prevent denial of service attacks,
implementing a proof of liabilities scheme for auditing mints, and building upon
the "[multinut payments](https://github.com/cashubtc/nuts/pull/103)" concept to
improve the utility of smaller Ecash balances.

> Our mission with Cashu is to create a robust ecash protocol built for Bitcoin
> with a focus on simplicity, efficiency, and privacy. Anyone should be able to
> build open-source applications powered by ecash. And anyone should be able to
> run them.
