---

OpenSats is pleased to announce the thirteenth wave of grants from our General
Fund for eight open-source projects that close privacy gaps, streamline
self-custody, and help fortify Bitcoin's technical core.

This round includes five first-time project grants and three grant renewals,
with every satoshi going straight to the developers and maintainers of each
respective project.

First-time project grants:

- [KMP-Tor](#kmp-tor)
- [DTails](#dtails)
- [Sats App](#sats-app)
- [ngx_L402](#ngx_l402)
- [Silent Payments Shepherd](#silent-payments-shepherd)

Grant renewals:

- [ASmap](/blog/bitcoin-grants-september-2024-7th-wave#asmap)
- [Blitz Wallet](/blog/bitcoin-grants-july-2024-6th-wave#blitz-wallet)
- [@hodlinator](/blog/caring-for-bitcoin-core#hodlinator)

Each project addresses a specific need—from drop-in Tor libraries and Silent
Payments coordination to hardened live-OS builds,
Nginx modules that allow for seamless monetization, and
merchant-ready e-cash wallets—strengthening privacy and
usability across the stack.

The ability to support these projects is made possible by the generosity of our
donors. If you would like to help us continue funding important advancements
within the Bitcoin ecosystem, please consider donating to the General Fund.

### KMP-Tor

[KMP-Tor](https://kmp-tor.matthewnelson.io/) is a [Kotlin
Multiplatform](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/multiplatform.html) (KMP) library
that embeds reproducible Tor binaries alongside a lightweight runtime, letting
Android, JVM, Kotlin/Native (Linux, macOS, iOS), and Node developers integrate
[Tor](/blog/tor-receives-support-grant) directly into their applications. The
project handles Tor's event loop and packaging complexities, providing projects
like [Sparrow Wallet](https://sparrowwallet.com),
[BitBanana](https://bitbanana.app), and [Sphinx Chat](https://sphinx.chat) with
a single dependency for privacy‑preserving network connectivity. For instance,
Sparrow upgraded to Tor
[`0.4.7.13`](https://github.com/torproject/tor/releases/tag/tor-0.4.7.13) by
simply updating its `kmp‑tor` version.

With support from this grant, maintainer [Matthew
Nelson](https://github.com/05nelsonm) will extend hardware coverage in the
companion [`kmp‑tor‑resource`](https://github.com/05nelsonm/kmp-tor-resource)
repository—adding `riscv64` builds for `Linux‑libc`,
`aarch64`/`riscv64`/`x86`/`x86_64` for `Linux‑musl`, and
`aarch64`/`x86`/`x86_64` for `FreeBSD`—and complete support for Tor's roughly
350 configuration options (about 250 implemented today). These milestones will
keep `kmp‑tor` a dependable drop‑in Tor solution across the Bitcoin ecosystem.

### DTails

DTails is an open‑source remastering tool for [Debian
Live](https://www.debian.org/CD/live/)‑based operating systems, such as
[Tails](https://tails.net/index.en.html), a privacy‑focused OS designed for
security and anonymity. Using a straightforward GUI, it opens a stock ISO, lets
users add or remove Bitcoin and privacy software such as [Sparrow
Wallet](https://sparrowwallet.com/), [Liana](https://wizardsardine.com/liana/),
[Bisq](https://bisq.network/), [SeedTool](https://seedtool.org/), [Specter
Desktop](https://specter.solutions/desktop/index.html), and more, then rebuilds
a bootable ISO in minutes with no persistence required. By automating package
selection and ISO assembly, DTails removes barriers to running hardened Bitcoin
toolsets on Tails.

With support from this grant, maintainer
[DesobedienteTecnologico](https://github.com/DesobedienteTecnologico) will
release a redesigned GUI, implement automated diffing that highlights every file
changed between the stock and customized ISOs, and refactor the codebase for
reliability. If there is enough community demand, the effort will expand into a
dedicated Tails fork pre‑bundled with Bitcoin tools, complete with its own
website and documentation.

### Sats App

Sats App is a native [Cashu](https://cashu.space/) wallet project that combines
a simple interface with new Swift- and Kotlin-based bindings to the Cashu
Development Kit ([CDK](https://github.com/cashubtc/cdk)). Powered by
[`cdk_flutter`](https://github.com/davidcaseria/cdk_flutter), it exposes the
CDK's Rust core to iOS and Android so an application can create a seed, connect
to a mint, and send/receive e-cash. The current code already covers seed
creation, mint connection, and token send/receive, giving merchants a
straightforward path to accept e-cash without extra setup.

With support from this grant, the project will release fully documented Swift
and Kotlin bindings, launch TestFlight and closed Android betas with local token
storage, and publish public builds in the App Store and Google Play. Efforts
will then shift to remote cloud backup, NFC tap-to-pay, and other
merchant-centric features—advancing toward the open-source "Cash App"
experience for Cashu.

### ngx_L402

The `ngx_L402` project is a lightweight [NGINX](https://nginx.org) module that
brings bitcoin-based payments directly to the web server. Written in
Rust and delivered as a native plug-in, it enforces the [L402 authentication
standard](https://github.com/lightninglabs/L402) from Lightning Labs and also
accepts [Cashu](https://cashu.space/) tokens for e-cash redemptions. By moving
payment checks inside NGINX instead of relying on
[Aperture](https://github.com/lightninglabs/aperture) as a separate reverse
proxy, it cuts latency, removes extra infrastructure, and lets any service
behind NGINX gate routes with bitcoin or Lightning payments out of the box.
[Predyx](https://beta.predyx.com/) and other early adopters are already testing
the module, and community feedback is guiding new feature requests.

With support from this grant, the roadmap will begin with core parity and
stabilization: [gRPC](https://grpc.io/) support, time-bounded and rate-limited
macaroons, enhanced logging, and a Docker image for quick deployment. It then
moves to Cashu security upgrades such as dynamic pricing, scheduled redemptions,
mint allowlists, and local double-spend protection, followed by
[Redis](https://redis.io/)-backed token storage, [Lightning Node
Connect](https://docs.lightning.engineering/lightning-network-tools/lightning-node-connect)
integration, and Tor support for .onion nodes. If time and resources allow, the
team will also add Core Lightning and Eclair support, publish tutorial
materials, and explore ports to other reverse proxies, all to make `ngx_L402`
the default tool for Lightning-based API monetization.

### Silent Payments Shepherd

Silent Payments Shepherd is a coordination hub that tracks, documents, and
unblocks every moving part of the [Silent
Payments](/blog/developing-advancements-in-onchain-privacy#silent-payments)
(`BIP-352`) ecosystem. Project maintainer
[MacGyver](https://github.com/macgyver13) curates a live developer dashboard,
keeps specifications in sync, and collaborates with wallet teams to integrate
Silent Payments—reusable-address that let senders create one-time
[Taproot](https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/taproot/) outputs without any
on-chain or out-of-band signalling,  improving privacy for payroll and other
payment workflows. By pairing project-management discipline with hands-on
coding, the role of Shepherd gives Silent Payments the cohesion it needs to move
from prototypes to production-ready software.

With support from this grant, the project will implement a five-phase roadmap:
revive development and publish a public progress tracker; harden cryptography
libraries and integrate wallet implementations in [Bitcoin
Core](https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-core/features/user-interface),
[Electrum](https://electrum.org/), and [Sparrow](https://sparrowwallet.com/);
define outsourced scanning and vending services so light clients can operate
efficiently; run guided pilots with real bitcoin to validate the entire
workflow; and work with exchanges to standardize human-readable reusable
addresses. Each milestone removes a critical blocker on the path to mainstream
adoption of Silent Payments across the Bitcoin stack.
