OpenSats is proud to announce long-term support for
[hrzd149](https://github.com/hzrd149), another prolific contributor to the nostr
ecosystem.

Hrzd149 is the creator of [noStrudel](https://nostrudel.ninja/), a fast
web-based nostr client with tools to explore the nostr protocol in depth. He is
also the brain behind [Blossom](https://github.com/hzrd149/blossom) (Blobs
Stored Simply on Mediaservers), which aims to simplify the storage and
organization of digital files in the nostr network.

This LTS grant will support Hrzd149's ongoing development of clients, tools, and
libraries in the nostr ecosystem. He will continue to work on noStrudel, adding
[nostr nests](https://github.com/nostrnests) support among other things. He will
also continue to build out Blossom, by adding components like
[blossom-drive](https://github.com/hzrd149/blossom-drive) for
censorship-resistant and efficient file hosting.

> My hope is that noStrudel becomes a valuable learning tool for open-source
> developers working with nostr, while Blossom addresses the critical demand for
> distributed, censorship-resistant file hosting and backup to enhance portability
> for nostr users and clients.
