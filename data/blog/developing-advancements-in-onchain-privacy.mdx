---

Bitcoin was founded on the promise of permissionless electronic cash, but its
transparent ledger means on-chain privacy remains an ongoing challenge. From
transaction heuristics to metadata leaks, those looking to surveil financial
activity have multiple avenues to track unsuspecting users. Greg Maxwell, a
pioneer in Bitcoin's open-source development, captured these privacy concerns
succinctly in 2013:

>Traditional banking provides a fair amount of privacy by default. Your inlaws
>don't see that you're buying birth control that deprives them of grandchildren,
>your employer doesn't learn about the non-profits you support with money from
>your paycheck, and thieves don't see your latest purchases or how wealthy you
>are to help them target and scam you. Poor privacy in Bitcoin can be a major
>practical disadvantage for both individuals and businesses.

Ensuring that bitcoin use remains private and secure requires ongoing
development, and OpenSats grantees are at the forefront of this effort. As part
of our mission to foster open-source Bitcoin development, OpenSats is dedicating
the next few months to highlighting the innovative work of our grantees. Today,
we highlight three privacy-focused initiatives supported by our General Fund, as
announced in [July](/blog/bitcoin-grants-july-2023#payjoin-dev-kit) 2023,
[August](/blog/josi-baker-receives-opensats-lts-grant) 2023, and
[October](/blog/8th-wave-of-bitcoin-grants#citadel-tech) 2024, respectively:

- [Async Payjoin](#async-payjoin)
- [Coinswap](#coinswap)
- [Silent Payments](#silent-payments)

The developers working on these projects are making meaningful impacts, with
real-world implementations in place and ongoing improvements ahead. Let's take a
closer look at how these projects are advancing and reinforcing Bitcoin's
privacy and thus end-user security.

### Async Payjoin

One of the most powerful tools for on-chain privacy is breaking the assumptions
used by blockchain surveillance, which are based on various heuristics and
transaction patterns.

One such assumption is the common input ownership heuristic
([CIOH](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Common-input-ownership_heuristic)), which
suggests that all inputs in a transaction belong to the same entity. The CIOH is
one of the most common methods to track payments and link addresses, effectively
degrading the privacy—and thus security—of all users. Payjoin disrupts this
heuristic, which in turn improves the privacy characteristics of the whole
network. Even if only a small percentage of users use Payjoin as their default
payment mechanism, the common input ownership heuristic can't be trusted
anymore, making it a useless heuristic for transaction deanonymization. *"The
main problem is that,"* as Francis Pouliot, CEO of [Bull
Bitcoin](https://www.bullbitcoin.com/) pointed out, *"to make it happen, a lot of
open-source software infrastructure was missing."*

Version 1 of Payjoin ([Pay-to-EndPoint](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/PayJoin))
disrupted the CIOH assumption by modifying how transactions are constructed.
Instead of a straightforward sender-to-recipient payment, the recipient also
contributes one of their inputs to the transaction. This process reduces the
effectiveness of common tracking and surveillance methods in use today. However,
the challenge with this version was that it required real-time, synchronous coordination,
meaning both sender and receiver had to be online at the same time, which is not
practical at scale.

Thanks in part to [OpenSats
funding](/blog/bitcoin-grants-july-2023#payjoin-dev-kit), Payjoin V2 ([BIP
77](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1483)) launched in 2024, implementing a
major improvement called Async Payjoin. Because of this, Payjoin V2 no
longer requires both sender and receiver to be online simultaneously, making
private and secure transactions seamless for users. This enhancement makes it
easier for mobile wallets and exchanges to integrate Payjoin by default without disrupting
their existing user workflows, making privacy and security protections more
accessible to a wider user base.

In December 2024, Bull Bitcoin Mobile became the first mobile wallet to enable
sending and receiving Async Payjoin. This
[milestone](https://www.bullbitcoin.com/blog/bull-bitcoin-wallet-payjoin) marks
a significant shift. Not only does Payjoin preserve privacy and security, but it
also allows businesses to batch multiple transactions—reducing on-chain
activity, and saving fees—while maintaining a streamlined user experience.
Francis Pouliot, CEO of Bull Bitcoin goes on to say:

>Without the OpenSats grant awarded to [Payjoin Dev
>Kit](https://github.com/payjoin), Payjoin V2 may never have come to exist and
>would have remained an idea in the mind of cypherpunks. Now that Payjoin Dev
>Kit has proven that an app like Bull Bitcoin can integrate Payjoin easily, many
>other apps are sure to follow. [...] Not only does this benefit users by
>offering them opportunistic UTXO consolidation without compromising on privacy,
>but it benefits the entire Bitcoin network by challenging the heuristics used
>by nefarious blockchain observers.

Indeed, multiple Payjoin V2 integrations are already live or in progress with
BitMask, Bitcoin Core, Galoy's Bria payment processor, and Boltz following Bull
Bitcoin's lead. By making Payjoin transactions indistinguishable from other
batch transactions, Payjoin Dev Kit reduces blockchain fingerprinting and
strengthens privacy and security for all.

### Coinswap

With financial surveillance becoming more prevalent and intrusive, tools that
protect privacy have become increasingly important for preserving financial
sovereignty. [Coinswap] has been actively developing a solution to address this
challenge—a decentralized atomic swap protocol that enables users to swap
bitcoin UTXOs, breaking direct ownership links on-chain and disrupting
chain-analysis heuristics.

Originally proposed by [Greg
Maxwell](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=321228.0) in 2013 and later
developed into a proof-of-concept by [Chris Belcher], the protocol is now
actively advancing through independent contributors, including developers from
[Citadel-Tech](https://github.com/citadel-tech), with funding from OpenSats.

Using a maker-taker model, swap service providers (makers) facilitate swaps,
while swap users (takers) rely on applications to automatically coordinate
multi-hop transactions for enhanced privacy. By passing bitcoin through multiple
addresses, these transactions add uncertainty for trackers by obscuring the true
sender and recipient. This blending of privacy-enhanced transactions with
standard bitcoin transactions makes it significantly harder for nefarious actors
to exploit financial surveillance, construct misleading transaction narratives,
or leverage data for unjust financial profiling.

Since receiving a grant from OpenSats in October last year, development has
focused on refining the smart-client (taker's application), dumb-server (maker's
server) model, and integrating [fidelity
bonds](https://jamdocs.org/glossary/#fidelity-bond) to resist [Sybil
attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybil_attack). Despite the protocol's
complexity, Coinswap prioritizes user-friendly workflows to make financial
privacy accessible.

The recent beta release of
[v0.1.0](https://github.com/citadel-tech/coinswap/milestone/1) marks a major
milestone towards making Coinswap use more prevalent. This testnet release aims
to demonstrate how swaps can function in real-world conditions without revealing
which participants exchanged UTXOs.

Looking ahead, the project plans to implement Taproot outputs, MuSig2 signatures
for smaller and more private transactions, and decentralized DNS discovery to
enable permissionless access to swap servers. The project is also exploring
cross-chain swaps with UTXO-based sidechains like Liquid.

By evolving alongside Bitcoin's broader ecosystem, Coinswap ensures that
financial privacy remains practical and widely available, empowering individuals
and businesses to transact freely without fear of surveillance.

### Silent Payments

Developed by OpenSats
[LTS](/blog/announcing-lts-grant-program-to-support-bitcoin-core-contributors)
grantee [Josie Baker](/blog/josi-baker-receives-opensats-lts-grant), Silent
Payments ([BIP
352](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0352.mediawiki)) is an
improvement proposal that enables users to receive bitcoin without revealing
their on-chain addresses. Without Silent Payments, users have to manually manage
new addresses, a task that quickly becomes cumbersome. History has shown that
address reuse continues to be widespread because many users prioritize
convenience over security, while others remain unaware that reusing addresses
compromises their privacy. By automatically generating a unique address for each
transaction, Silent Payments eliminates manual address management while ensuring
greater privacy and security by default.

Silent Payments has been under active development throughout 2024, focusing on
integration into Bitcoin Core, [third-party
wallets](https://silentpayments.xyz/docs/wallets/), and developer libraries.
Multiple [pull requests](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/28536) have
been opened to implement essential features like address generation and
transaction handling, alongside ongoing work on the [`libsecp256k1`][libsecp] module to
optimize cryptographic operations.

Beyond Bitcoin Core, Silent Payments is being integrated into the [`rust-bitcoin`][rust]
library to streamline adoption in Rust-based applications. Developers have also
introduced [SilentPay], a TypeScript library designed to facilitate easy
cross-platform implementation, ensuring broader access to the protocol.

Frequent Bitcoin users look forward to Silent Payments for its potential to
simplify and strengthen on-chain privacy. Although still in active development,
its integration across multiple platforms marks a significant step forward for
Bitcoin, reinforcing privacy, security, and financial sovereignty for
individuals and businesses alike.

### Looking Ahead

The advancements achieved by OpenSats grantees in [Payjoin][PJ], [Coinswap][CS], and [Silent
Payments][SP] mark significant progress with on-chain privacy, disrupting transaction
surveillance, while promoting greater financial sovereignty.

These scalable innovations are making robust, user-friendly privacy solutions a
reality for individuals and businesses, ensuring that Bitcoin remains a truly
permissionless and resilient digital cash system. And while these projects
represent major steps forward, they are just one part of a broader effort to
make Bitcoin even more efficient and secure. Across the ecosystem, developers are
continuously working on new solutions, many of which are supported by OpenSats.

Bitcoin's advancement depends on active, collaborative development, with
open-source software as the core driver of Bitcoin as a neutral monetary
network. OpenSats remains committed to funding open-source developers and
