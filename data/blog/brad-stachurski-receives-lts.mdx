OpenSats is pleased to announce long-term support for [Brad Stachurski] for his
ongoing work on Fedimint, a federated Chaumian ecash system for Bitcoin.

Brad has helped coordinate core releases and operational improvements that make
[Fedimint] safer to upgrade and easier to run. As a co-maintainer, he focuses on
the security, reliability, and operability of production deployments. He shipped
the [v0.8.0 release], which included “Fedimint In-A-Box” enhancements such as
[Iroh]-based connectivity for federation operators and a [StartOS package] for
mainnet federations. He has continued improving [the package] for clearer
configuration options and more dependable backup and restore workflows.

With long-term support, Brad plans to continue work across core maintainer
responsibilities, including:

- Coordinate security fixes and safe rollouts across deployments.
- Run releases: testing, compatibility checks, and upgrade support.
- Review codebase changes, including consensus mechanisms and client APIs.
- Improve deployment tooling, including packaging and self-hosted setups.
- Maintain [ecash-app] and use it as a test client in the release workflow.

Our [mission] is to provide sustainable funding for the builders and maintainers
of critical open-source infrastructure within the Bitcoin ecosystem.

The [Long-Term Support program] is made possible by the generosity of our
donors. To continue supporting contributors like Brad and our [other LTS
grantees], consider making a recurring donation to the [General Fund].
