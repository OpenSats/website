summary: "OpenSats secures a $116,000 grant from HRF’s Bitcoin Development Fund for our Operations Budget."
---

OpenSats has received a \$116,000 grant from the Human Rights Foundation's
[Bitcoin Development Fund] for our Operations Budget, following [a \$250,000
grant last year]. This grant was part of HRF's Q4 2025 [donation round], which
distributed 1.3 billion satoshis in funding to 22 freedom tech projects
worldwide.

The [Human Rights Foundation] (HRF) defends global human rights by supporting
dissidents and challenging authoritarian regimes. Its Bitcoin Development Fund
backs projects that enhance Bitcoin's privacy, security, usability, and
decentralization to promote financial freedom for people living under repressive
conditions.

OpenSats is a 501(c)(3) public charity focused on sustainable funding for free
and open-source software in the Bitcoin, nostr, and broader freedom tech
ecosystems. We keep operational funding separate so that donations to our
program funds continue to flow directly to developers and their open-source
projects.

>Open and transparent funding is key to sustaining many of the freedom
>technologies human rights defenders rely on today. OpenSats is a public
>nonprofit organization that supports the projects and the individuals building
>freedom tech by distributing financial support across the ecosystem. With this
>grant, OpenSats can fortify its operations and continue channeling resources to
>the builders who keep freedom tech open, secure, and accessible for people
>living under tyranny.

The Operations Budget covers the core work required to run a careful and
transparent [grantmaking process]: reviewing applications, performing technical
and security due diligence, coordinating with grantees, managing accounting and
compliance, and maintaining the systems and governance structures that keep our
decisions consistent and mission aligned. This grant extends our operational
runway, strengthens the reliability of our support for contributors across
Bitcoin and nostr, and allows us to maintain longer-term commitments where they
are most needed.

We are grateful to the Human Rights Foundation for their trust and alignment
with [our mission]. If you share our commitment to fostering open-source
development in the Bitcoin ecosystem, please consider making a recurring
donation to our [Operations Budget]. Your support strengthens the infrastructure
behind our grantmaking and enables us to keep channeling resources to builders
advancing open, censorship-resistant technology
