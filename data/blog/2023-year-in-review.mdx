The year is coming to an end, and what a year it's been! Amidst all the turmoil
that 2023 brought, the Bitcoin network tirelessly marched on, bringing hope and
optimism to millions. Block by block it continues to lay the foundation for a
better and brighter future, not only economically, but spiritually and
philosophically too. If something like Bitcoin can be created and manages to
survive, what other bastions of freedom will we be able to create? What kind of
freedom tech could we come up with in the years to come if we dedicate our time
and resources to it? What foundational technologies can we create today that
will enrich the lives of future generations?

The emergence of nostr shows that financial freedom is far from the only thing
people care about. Freedom of expression, freedom of speech, and freedom of
association are rights that many of us take for granted. Unfortunately, they
aren't the default in cyberspace. But they can be. If we set our mind to it, and
if we build the threads that make up the fabric of society with care and
foresight.

> We can rebuild it. We have the technology.

We at OpenSats believe that open systems are essential to the future of the
internet and the world. They allow people to collaborate and share knowledge,
without being locked into proprietary software or hardware. They allow people to
vote with their digital feet, providing meaningful alternatives to permissioned
systems.

We care about free and open-source software because we believe that an [open
society in the electronic
age](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/cypherpunk-manifesto/#selection-3.0-3.63) is
not only possible but paramount. For a truly free society, openness is not a
luxury, but a necessity.

> Being open source means anyone can independently review the code. If it was
> closed source, nobody could verify the security. I think it's essential for a
> program of this nature to be open source.
>
> <cite>—Satoshi Nakamoto on Bitcoin</cite>

In the spirit of openness, let's take some time to pause and reflect upon the
announcements we made this year, what we did to pursue [our mission](/mission),
and what kinds of projects we were able to support thanks to the generous
donations made by all of you.

## Announcements

In May this year, in addition to the many donations of our amazing supporters
all over the world, we received a large amount of [funding from
\#startsmall](/blog/opensats-receives-additional-funding-of-dollar10m-from-startsmall),
which kicked our efforts into high gear. Thanks to this donation we were able to
bootstrap our [long-term support
program](/blog/announcing-lts-grant-program-to-support-bitcoin-core-contributors)
as well as [The Nostr Fund](/projects/nostr), giving
meaningful support to bitcoin infrastructure engineers and the nostr ecosystem.

In July we announced our first wave of grants for
[bitcoin](/blog/bitcoin-grants-july-2023) and
[nostr](/blog/nostr-grants-july-2023), kickstarting our
general grant program. We’ve truly started small with about a dozen grants each,
doing our best to [select outstanding projects](/selection)
with the help of our domain-expert committees and
[volunteers](/about#volunteers).

In August we announced our [second wave of
grants](/blog/bitcoin-and-nostr-grants-august-2023)
alongside an expansion of our long-term support program. In addition to building
out our grant programs we made significant efforts to expand our team and
streamline our processes, iterating towards becoming the most efficient
sat-dispensing machine we can be.

In September we introduced [Nostr
Design](/blog/announcing-nostr-design), an initiative aimed
at helping developers provide the best user experience possible. We also shared
our thoughts on [bitcoin infrastructure this
decade](/blog/bitcoin-infrastructure-this-decade), outlining
how we, as a non-profit organization, aim to fund and practice what we preach:
low time preference and long-term thinking.

In October we announced our [third wave of nostr
grants](/blog/nostr-grants-october-2023), along with four
new LTS grantees:
[Vasil](/blog/vasil-dimov-receives-lts-grant),
[Gleb](/blog/gleb-naumenko-receives-lts-grant),
[Matt](/blog/matt-morehouse-lightning-security-lts-grant),
and
[Furszy](/blog/furszy-receives-lts-grant-for-bitcoin-core),
who joined the pack after
[Marco](/blog/announcing-lts-grant-program-to-support-bitcoin-core-contributors),
[Josi](/blog/josi-baker-receives-opensats-lts-grant), and
[Sjors](/blog/sjors-provoost-receives-opensats-lts-grant).
Shortly after that we announced long-term support for
[Will](/blog/will-clark-receives-lts-grant-for-bitcoin-core)
in November, and most recently
[Tobin](/blog/tobin-harding-receives-lts-grant-for-rust-bitcoin)
in December.

In December we also announced our third wave of grants for
[bitcoin](/blog/bitcoin-grants-december-2023) and
[nostr](/blog/nostr-grants-december-2023) respectively,
bringing our total number of grants announced this year to 76.

None of these things would’ve been possible without the generous support of our
donors. If you’d like to support our work, please consider [making a donation](/donate).

With a general overview of our activities in 2023 in place, let’s “run the
numbers” by providing a breakdown of donations, our current allocation of
grants, as well as a visual overview of grantee growth and what kinds of
projects we supported.

## Donations

We received over 900 donations this year, 87% of which were made in sats
directly. That's an increase of 280% compared to the number of donations
received in the previous year.

Of the 87% of donations received via bitcoin payment rails, 74% of the donations
in 2023 were made via Lightning.

![](/static/images/blog/2023-eoy/donations.png)

As mentioned above, out of the hundreds of donations received this year, one
stood out in particular: the \$10M donation from
[\#startsmall](https://startsmall.llc/) which kickstarted [The Nostr
Fund](/projects/nostr) with \$5M, filled up our [General
Fund](/projects/general_fund) with \$4.7M, and provided funding for our
[Operations Budget](/projects/opensats_operations_budget) with \$330k.  The
remaining donations in 2023 amounted to over 660 million sats or \$230,000 at
the time of donation. The vast majority of donations were made towards our
General Fund.

## Allocation

We have two funds that are dedicated 100% to funding free and open-source
projects: the [General Fund](/projects/general_fund)
(orange) and [The Nostr Fund](/projects/nostr) (purple). The
General Fund is geared towards high-quality projects that are bitcoin-centric or
bitcoin-related, while The Nostr Fund is geared towards—surprise, surprise—nostr
projects. As nostr is still developing, we tried to support a broad array of
projects and initiatives, including experimental and exploratory work.

Our General Fund is almost fully allocated as of this writing, with ~\$4.8M
donations received in 2023 and ~\$4.3M allocated. The Nostr Fund is on track to
be fully allocated by the end of Q1 2024, with ~\$3.4M out of \$5M going towards a
variety of free and open-source projects in the nostr ecosystem as of this
writing.

![](/static/images/blog/2023-eoy/allocation.png)

We still have dozens of applications in the pipeline that were submitted in
2023, and we are doing our best to discuss and evaluate each submission properly
and fairly. We are selecting new projects for funding every week and will
announce new grants once funding decisions are made.

We suspect that the distinction between “bitcoin” and “nostr” will get more
blurry over time, as nostr matures and gets integrated into a variety of bitcoin
software across the stack. If the current trend is any indication, nostr might
become the de facto address book of bitcoin wallets, a useful communication
layer to coordinate collaborative custody, federations, and collaborative
transactions, as well as a way to authenticate yourself and find peers you can
trust.

In 2023, the distinction between bitcoin and nostr was still quite clear, so
let’s break it down and have a look at the projects and initiatives we funded in
these two overarching categories.

### Bitcoin: General Fund

Our main focus at the beginning of 2023 was to create a grant program that
allows for meaningful support for Bitcoin Core developers and similar
[Load-Bearing Internet People](http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=8383). We received a
lot of help and insights from our friends at
[Brink](https://brink.dev/news/2021/08/05/grant-process.html),
[Chaincode](https://adamjonas.com/bitcoin/funding/funding-bitcoin-development/),
and the [HRF](https://hrf.org/devfund), and took many notes studying [other
successful grant programs](https://blog.bitmex.com/grants/) for open-source
developers in the bitcoin space.

This culminated in the launch of our long-term support (LTS) program. Of the
funds committed towards bitcoin projects from the General Fund, 40% have been
allocated to our LTS program for long-term grants.

![](/static/images/blog/2023-eoy/lts-grantees.png)

We are pleased to see that many high-quality developers applied and continue to
apply. In 2023, we went from zero LTS grantees in June to eleven LTS grantees in
December. [Marco

Harding](/blog/tobin-harding-receives-lts-grant-for-rust-bitcoin)
have received long-term support from OpenSats in 2023. Two additional grants
were approved in December and will be announced soon.

The remaining 60% of our General Fund has been allocated to bitcoin-related
projects in support of our mission. As mentioned above, we announced three waves
of bitcoin grants so far: one in
[July](/blog/bitcoin-grants-july-2023), one in
[August](/blog/bitcoin-and-nostr-grants-august-2023), and
one in [December](/blog/bitcoin-grants-december-2023),
respectively.

We are constantly processing and evaluating applications, and we will announce
more grants that are sourced from the General Fund soon.

### Nostr: The Nostr Fund

In 2023, our main focus for The Nostr Fund was to support projects that make
nostr more accessible, secure, decentralized, and easy to use. We also provided
support to projects that educate people about nostr and its potential, as well
as use-case exploration and more experimental endeavors.

We gave out four waves of nostr grants, as announced in
[July](/blog/nostr-grants-july-2023),
[August](/blog/bitcoin-and-nostr-grants-august-2023),
[October](/blog/nostr-grants-october-2023), and
[December](/blog/nostr-grants-december-2023).

The following nostr projects received support from OpenSats in 2023:

Machine Framework.

In addition to the above grants we helped launch the [Nostr
Design](https://nostrdesign.org/) initiative spearheaded by
Karnage,
[Daniele](/about/dtonon), and
Niel.

If you’re looking for design feedback or help, reach out to us or use the
[#nostrdesign](https://nostr.band/?q=%23nostrdesign) hashtag.

As you can see in the chart below, most of our nostr-related grants went towards
client development, which is an area that needed a lot of support in the early
stages of this novel protocol.

![](/static/images/blog/2023-eoy/nostr-distribution.png)

We are excited to see nostr grow and, slowly but surely, mature. It is
undoubtedly still early days, so we expect a shift from clients to “other stuff”
in the coming years. However, it is fantastic to see a censorship-resistant and
sat-infused social media protocol taking off, and we are incredibly optimistic
about its future. If you are working on a nostr-related open-source project,
don’t hesitate to [apply for funding](/apply/grant) so you
might join our growing list of grantees. If you want to support the nostr
ecosystem, consider making a donation to The Nostr Fund:

## Grantees

After the initial wave of grants announced in July, we’ve added around 10
grantees each month on average, totaling 90 approved grants as of this writing
(not all of them announced yet).

We have received some great feedback from grantees in 2023 already, and we can’t
wait to see the fruits of everyone’s labor in the months and years to come. We
hope to share select updates and progress reports from grantees at some point in
the future. For now, our main focus remains on [project
selection](/selection) and fund distribution.

![](/static/images/blog/2023-eoy/grantees.png)

Most of our grants are being paid out monthly. In sum we've sent more than seven
billion sats to our grantees, in addition to a \$1M grant given to
[GrapheneOS](/projects/grapheneos) at the beginning of the
year. We will continue to support bitcoin-adjacent projects like Graphene and
[The Tor Project](/projects/tor), as many people have to
rely on these tools to use bitcoin in a secure and self-sovereign way.

We expect to have over 100 grantees by Q2 of 2024, given past growth and pending
grant applications. We hope to support many of our grantees for the long-term,
as long as funding permits and progress remains aligned with our mission.

## Outlook

One of our overall goals is to help provide an ecosystem of sustainable funding
for open-source developers in the bitcoin ecosystem. Thanks to our generous
donors, we have made great strides towards achieving this goal, and we are
optimistic that we will be able to continue to provide support for a variety of
projects and developers.

We hope that it will become increasingly obvious that development and
maintenance of free and open-source software is continuous and arduous work;
work that requires adequate compensation and support for developers. We all rely
on the tireless efforts of countless FOSS contributors—some seen, some unseen.

We rely on donations to fund our operations and the projects we support. Unlike
most charities, we don't take a cut from donations to fund ourselves.
Consequently, we have to fund our operations separately. If you like what we’re
doing please consider donating to our [Operations
Budget](/projects/opensats_operations_budget).

<center>
    <DonateToOperationsButton/>
</center>

We deeply appreciate all support and hope this “year in review” is helpful in
understanding what we are building. We are incredibly grateful for our grantees
and everyone working on bitcoin and freedom tech. Thank you for focusing your
time and attention on a bright and hopeful future. We will do our best to do the
same.

Here’s to a great 2024. Onward!
