summary: "OpenSats is funding 10 more open-source projects in the bitcoin space."
---

One aspect of Bitcoin that is often overlooked is that, no matter how crazy the
news cycle (or the mempools) might be, Bitcoin marches on, unbothered. Every 10
minutes, transactions are being settled. Every 10 minutes, the network focuses
on a new block. Every 10 minutes, the timechain is flourishing. It is the
constant signal in an increasingly noisy world.

While OpenSats doesn't operate in 10-minute intervals like Bitcoin does, we aim
to filter the signal from the noise and consistently execute just the same. Our
[mission](/mission) is to support and maintain a sustainable ecosystem of
funding for free and open-source projects and contributors, especially
Bitcoin-related projects and projects that help Bitcoin flourish. In other
words: we want Bitcoin's open-source contributors to flourish alongside Bitcoin
and have them unbothered, moisturized, happy, and focused.

We are proud to announce 10 new grants to impactful projects in the Bitcoin
space. In no particular order, here they are:

- [Clams](#clams)
- [Fully Noded](#fully-noded)
- [Validating Lightning Signer](#validating-lightning-signer)
- [Fedimint Lightning Gateway](#fedimint-lightning-gateway)
- [Pickhardt Payments plugin for Core-Lightning](#pickhardt-payments-plugin-for-core-lightning)
- [BitBanana](#bitbanana)
- [Crack the Orange](#crack-the-orange)
- [Bitcoin Core App](#bitcoin-core-app)
- [Krux](#krux)
- [Vexl](#vexl)

All of the above grants are sourced from our [General Fund][gf], which is funded by
generous donors like you. If you want to help us support free and open-source
projects please consider donating to the fund:

This brings the total number of grants given by OpenSats to 69, including the
eight [long-term support grants](/tags/lts) we announced previously, as well as
the 32 grants announced for [nostr](/tags/nostr).

As always, let's take a closer look at the projects to understand what they are
about and how they align with our mission.

### Clams

Clams is an interface for CLN nodes that establishes a secure and encrypted
connection directly through the Lightning Network. After user-defined
permissions are added, the app can execute various functions on the node like
sending and receiving payments.

Payment options include Keysend, BOLT11 invoices, LNURL, and BOLT12 offers.
Other notable features include lightning channel management and a bookkeeping
dashboard.

The app is a Progressive Web App (PWA) meaning it works on all devices that have
a browser. It has a mobile experience that is similar to Zeus. The desktop
version is more advanced, with a UX akin to Ride The Lightning.  Clams is
privacy-focused, does no logging, has no trackers, and all data stays on the
user's device.

### Fully Noded

Fully Noded is the first app for iOS and macOS that allows users to connect to
their node via RPC over Tor for a truly self-sovereign Bitcoin experience. It
utilizes PSBTs and descriptors to expose all of the excellent wallet
functionality that Bitcoin Core offers. It supports BIP39 seeds, has easy
integration with hardware signing devices, and is easy to use when compared to
managing funds with `bitcoin-cli`.

The Fully Noded stack has the potential to make “one-click” self-sovereign
Bitcoin usage a thing, as it is non-custodial and private by default.

### Validating Lightning Signer

Validating Lightning Signer (VLS) is an open-source project whose goal is to
improve the security of the Lightning Network. Currently, the user's Lightning
private keys are stored on the Lightning node itself. This poses a risk: if
someone manages to hack into a node, they could steal the user's Bitcoin. It's
like leaving your money in a vault but hanging the key on the vault's door.

VLS brings to Bitcoin Lightning what signing devices brought to Bitcoin:
improved security via a reduced attack surface. In the future, VLS plans to
implement multisig support, further improving security for Lightning Network
users.

### Fedimint Lightning Gateway

Fedimint is an open-source framework for creating federated applications.
Fedimints have the ability to custody bitcoin on behalf of clients of the
federation and issue e-cash in return. Ecash transfers between participants of
the federation can be done with almost perfect privacy since notes are
transferred between clients using blind signatures.

Fedimints can also accept and send payments over Lightning using a Lightning
Gateway. The Lightning Gateway provides a swap service between ecash notes of a
federation and the broader Lightning network. Lightning Gateways are the glue
that allows Fedimints to participate in the broader Bitcoin ecosystem. They
abstract away the details of Fedimints and expose a user experience that feels
like using a Lightning wallet.

The Lightning Gateway portion of Fedimint is important since it provides the
connection between federations as well as to the broader Lightning network.
Without Lightning support, the utility of federations is limited, since
transactions can only be facilitated among clients of the federation. The
Lightning support opens up Fedimint to the rest of the Bitcoin ecosystem. A
client of Fedimint can pay to and receive from anything that "speaks" lightning.

### Pickhardt Payments plugin for Core-Lightning

Pickhardt Payments is a novel payment routing strategy for the Lightning
Network, originally developed in 2021 by Rene Pickhardt and Stefan Richter
([arxiv.org/abs/2107.05322](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.05322)).

The method is based on a Bayesian description of the liquidity state of
channels, with the precise allocation of liquidity unknown by the nodes of the
network. An optimally reliable Multipath Payment (MPP) can be constructed by
solving a Minimum Cost Flow (MCF) problem, where the cost function weights the
probability of path failures due to insufficient liquidity.

The implementation of the Pickhardt-Richter method promises to bring a huge leap
of improvement in the payments layer of the Lightning Network without the need
to change the protocol's basic rules. From the users' point of view, it'll allow
for a faster payment experience and fewer chances of payment failures.

### BitBanana

BitBanana aims to provide the best User Experience for remote Lightning Node
Management on Android. Additionally to managing the node, BitBanana allows its
users to access the wallet functionality of their node in everyday situations.
The focus of the app is remote management, which makes it a great open-source
tool for node operators. The app was originally known as "Zap Android" before it
was forked and rebranded.

### Crack the Orange

Crack the Orange is an educational effort that is building a cohort of Bitcoin
educators. The current goal is to train a total of 100 educators, community
builders, and human rights activists per year. It is estimated that each of
these individuals will onboard another ~10 peers in their communities with the
knowledge acquired, spreading Bitcoin knowledge organically and peer-to-peer.

Any educational material produced by the project under this grant will be made
publicly available and published under a permissive license that is appropriate
for the content, i.e. one of the free licenses listed at
[gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html).

### Bitcoin Core App

The Bitcoin Core App is a modern and cross-platform UI designed by the Bitcoin
Design community. It features new backend models that unravel the technical
locks that the current Core GUI is plagued with, all without disturbing the need
to further modularize the different components of Bitcoin Core.

The effort aims to keep Bitcoin Core accessible to run, and the features that
full-node software can provide are easy and intuitive to use by non-technical
people. Additionally, by exploring how Core behaves on mobile devices, we can
reshape how we think about full-node software and further democratize
enforcement of the network rules to those with mobile devices. With Core running
as a background process on phones and tablets, apps and services can be built to
use the local node instead of relying on remote nodes or a centralized server.

### Krux

Krux is a free and open-source firmware that enables anyone to build their own
Bitcoin signing device via off-the-shelf parts. It runs on Kendryte K210
Risk-V-based devices such as the M5StickV and Maix Amigo, converting them into
air-gapped devices that can sign transactions for single and multisig wallets.
Krux can also sign messages and has easy-to-use tools to help with the creation
and loading of wallet backups.

Users can choose to buy a ready-to-use device—where all they need is to flash
the firmware—or make a DIY version themselves. Krux can also run, mainly for
educational purposes, on PCs and Android devices.

### Vexl

Vexl is a free and open-source mobile app giving its users a simple, accessible,
and safe way to trade bitcoin as it was intended: peer-to-peer and without KYC.
Vexl is a non-profit, takes no fees from the trades that are happening on the
platform, and doesn't store any user data.

The mission of Vexl is to make peer-to-peer and non-KYC bitcoin accessible to
anyone without the need to go through a trusted third party.
