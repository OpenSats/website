---

OpenSats is pleased to announce its long-term support for [Andrew Toth] in
recognition of his ongoing contributions to Bitcoin Core. His work has focused
on performance and privacy enhancements that improve the experience of running a
fully validating node.

Andrew is an active, long-time [contributor to Bitcoin Core], with contributions
spanning initial block download (IBD), block-connection logic, caching behavior,
and RPC performance.

His improvements to [IBD and block-connection speed for pruned nodes] have
provided significant changes for users operating with limited disk resources,
and he has continued refining critical performance areas of the codebase as
network conditions and hardware constraints evolve.

In addition to working on performance, Andrew authored [BIP 374] and co-authored
[BIP 375], which together help support [silent payments] through [PSBTs].

He has also been involved in testing and reviewing Bitcoin Core's
private-broadcast work, with the goal of improving network-level privacy for
users who operate their own nodes.

Andrew's other contributions to projects such as [bitcoinjs], [rust-bitcoin],
and [Electrum Personal Server] reflect his commitment to the benefit of the
Bitcoin ecosystem.

With support from this LTS grant, Andrew plans to continue work on several areas
of Bitcoin Core, including:

- Continued improvements in [IBD and block-connection performance].
- Advancing [private transaction broadcast] and contributing to the follow-up
  changes to make it reliable for users.
- Refining caching and validation code to simplify performance-sensitive paths
  and improve maintainability.
- Providing ongoing review across validation, performance, and privacy-related
  changes within Bitcoin Core.

Our [mission] at OpenSats is to provide sustainable funding for the builders and
maintainers of critical open-source infrastructure within the Bitcoin ecosystem.

The OpenSats [Long-Term Support program] is made possible by the generosity of
our donors. To help ensure sustainable funding for contributors like Andrew Toth
and our [other LTS grantees], please consider setting up a recurring donation.
