summary: "An impact report from the front-lines of bitcoin and Lightning wallet development."
---

Wallet and node software form the core of Bitcoin's free and open financial
ecosystem. They define how people hold, send, and verify their bitcoin without
depending on intermediaries. As the network grows, these tools continue to
evolve towards stronger privacy, smoother interoperability, and better usability.

Over the past year, a new wave of development has advanced both on-chain and
Lightning self-custody. Developers have improved the speed and reliability of
mobile and desktop wallets, added advanced features once reserved for experts,
and made complex Bitcoin functions more intuitive. This progress shows that ease
of use and technical depth can advance together without compromising security or
control.

With support from OpenSats, the six projects featured in this impact report
represent advances in Bitcoin and Lightning wallet development.

The projects highlighted in this impact report are:

- [Bitcoin Safe](#bitcoin-safe)
- [Blixt Wallet](#blixt-wallet)
- [Blitz Wallet](#blitz-wallet)
- [Clams](#clams)
- [Cove](#cove)
- [Satsigner](#satsigner)

The above list is not exhaustive. OpenSats has supported many more wallet
projects, which we plan to highlight in future impact reports. We are also
providing funding to several [ecash wallets](/blog/advancements-in-ecash).

These projects demonstrate the ongoing refinement of self-custody across the
Bitcoin ecosystem. From full-node operators to mobile-first users, developers
are closing the gap between technical sophistication and everyday reliability.
The result is a more capable and accessible network built on verifiable code and
open collaboration.

Let's take a closer look at how each of these projects is making an impact.

### Bitcoin Safe

[Bitcoin Safe] is a savings wallet built for secure, private, long-term
self-custody. It helps users manage their bitcoin holdings through a simple
interface while maintaining control of funds.

Funding [from OpenSats] enabled ongoing improvements in reliability and
transparency. The wallet now connects directly to Bitcoin's network for [live
transaction notifications], removing the need for centralized servers. Users can
see on-chain confirmations in real time while preserving privacy.

[Support] for hardware wallets like Blockstream Jade Plus expanded compatibility
and security. The wallet also [warns] about look-alike address scams to help users 
avoid common attack patterns.

Behind the interface, Bitcoin Safe is prepared for full adoption of [Compact
Block Filters] (BIP157/158). Wallets download compact filters from peers and
match them locally, removing address or xpub lookups against third-party
servers. This improves privacy while remaining lightweight and reduces reliance
on centralized indexers. Project developers collaborated with the Bitcoin Dev
Kit (`BDK`) community to refine handling of unconfirmed transactions, address
lookahead, and encrypted storage, helping improve BDK-based wallets overall.

>Compact Block Filters in wallets, like Bitcoin Safe, are the best way to have
>fast UX while removing centralization points, such as electrum servers.
>
><cite>—Andreas Griffin</cite>

Translation support helps make the wallet accessible to users in multiple
languages for broader usability, while the use of [nostr] enables private data
synchronization, label sharing, and multi-signature coordination across devices
through its "Sync & Chat" tool. This system reduces trust in centralized
infrastructure while allowing smooth collaboration between co-signers.

Bitcoin Safe brings modern Bitcoin libraries and decentralized communication
tools together in one application built for long-term savings, showing how
open-source development makes self-custody practical.

### Blixt Wallet

[Blixt Wallet] is a non-custodial Bitcoin Lightning wallet for Android and iOS,
focused on usability and control. Built with `LND` and `Neutrino`, it lets users
run a full Lightning node directly on their device without relying on
centralized services.

With [a grant from OpenSats], Blixt rebuilt its core around
[`react-native-turbo-lnd`], a C++ module that runs the Lightning Network Daemon
(LND) directly inside the app, allowing faster Lightning payments without
relying on background software. A new feature called Speedloader helps the app
start quickly and stay in sync even on slower connections. This model provides a
reference for other projects with similar goals.

The project also released tools for developers building Lightning apps. For
example, [`react-native-turbo-sqlite`] stores wallet data securely on a phone,
and [`react-native-nitro-tor`] enables Tor-based privacy. Work continues on
making Blixt compatible with Windows devices using React Native, allowing the
same experience across operating systems.

Blixt improved reliability through [updates to Neutrino], the lightweight
Bitcoin client used for transaction verification. The wallet now connects to
multiple peers in different regions, keeping connections steady and reducing
delays during synchronization. These refinements address a long-standing
challenge in mobile self-custody.

The project also introduced `Lightning Box`, a trust-minimized version of the
Lightning Address protocol. It lets users receive payments to human-readable
addresses, such as user@domain, while keeping custody local. A lightweight HTTP
relay forwards payment requests to the recipient's wallet and returns the
invoice for payment.

>Having a trust-minimized Lightning Address linked to a self-custodial wallet 
>is a valuable option in a custodial Lightning world.
>
><cite>—Hampus Sjöberg</cite>

Released on Android in [version 0.6.9-420] and documented as an open protocol
draft ([`bLIP`]), Lightning Box is available for other wallets to adopt.

These improvements make Blixt a dependable, self-custodial wallet and a model
for secure Lightning applications. Ongoing progress on push-to-wake handling,
platform support, and Lightning Service Provider compatibility continues this
trajectory.

### Blitz Wallet

[Blitz Wallet] is a self-custodial Bitcoin ecosystem focused on making payments
simple. Its main product, the Blitz Mobile App, previously unified Lightning,
Liquid, and ecash balances into one platform and has now transitioned to the
Spark protocol. The goal remains to make Bitcoin payments accessible while
ensuring users maintain full control of their funds.

Over the past year, Blitz refined its approach to onboarding new Bitcoin users
through a “custodial ladder” model—starting with easy, guided defaults and
progressing toward full self-custody. Built with the `Breez SDK`, `Blockstream
Greenlight`, and the `Blockstream Green Development Kit`, Blitz combined these
open-source tools to provide a strong foundation while using Boltz for automatic
channel rebalancing. However, maintaining multiple networks introduced
complexity and fragmented balances.

With OpenSats' [support], Blitz streamlined its design into a simpler,
Spark-based wallet. The latest version enables receiving payments while offline,
maintaining inbound capacity, and exiting directly to on-chain bitcoin. A new
[`Progressive Web App`] version [works on any browser] without relying on the
app store.

Blitz has integrated a built-in store, contact-based payments, and
[point-of-sale tools]. Through integrations with services like [The Bitcoin
Company], [PPQ AI], [LN VPN], and [SMS4Sats], users can buy gift cards, access
online services, and send messages using sats.

To improve reliability and privacy, the project adopted Blockstream's [lwk-rn]
library for Liquid integration on iOS and migrated to the [Breez Liquid SDK] for
better swap handling and refunds. [React Native Firebase integration] added
device attestation for backend security. Blitz also introduced a [nodeless mode]
for users who prefer not to maintain a live node.

>Simplicity of use is the difference between Bitcoin as a cypherpunk technology
>and Bitcoin as a monetary revolution.
>
><cite>—Blake Kaufman</cite>

As the first live reference implementation of [Spark], Blitz offers insight for
developers exploring the protocol. Each iteration of Blitz development continues
to reduce mental effort while preserving sovereignty, showing that convenience
and self-custody can progress together. Through its seven public codebases and
coordination with upstream developers, Blitz contributes to the Bitcoin
development stack, demonstrating how simplicity and sovereignty can align for a
great user experience.

### Clams

[Clams] is a web-based interface for managing Core Lightning (CLN) nodes. It
connects node operations with self-custodial tools across desktop and mobile.
Operators can send and receive payments, manage channels, and monitor node
activity through encrypted connections and user-defined permissions without
relying on third parties.

The project supports Lightning payment methods like instant `Keysend` transfers,
standard Lightning invoices (`BOLT11`), reusable invoices (`BOLT12`), and
Lightning URLs (`LNURL`). As a `Progressive Web App`, it offers a consistent
browser experience with tools for channel management, payments, plugin control,
and UTXO tracking.

Supported [by OpenSats], Clams released [Remote v2], rebuilding the interface
around a local database for faster performance and scalability. Nodes processing
over 100,000 payments now benefit from better stability. The update added
multi-CLN connections, passphrase-encrypted sessions, and ready-to-install
desktop versions. [Version 2.1] introduced multilingual support, starting with
Spanish.

Clams simplified self-hosting through a [full integration] with Start9's
StartOS, allowing one-click installation and updates. Features like the
[`Plugins Dashboard`] have simplified a complex setup, making it manageable for
small businesses and educators locally.

One major update was the unified dashboard for two CLN plugins: CLBOSS, which
automates liquidity management, and [BOLT12 Prisms], which enables payment
splitting across recipients.

>Core Lightning's plugin ecosystem contains powerful tools like CLBOSS for
>automated liquidity management and BOLT12 Prisms for payment splitting, but
>interacting with these plugins requires command-line knowledge. Remote solves
>this by providing the first comprehensive plugin dashboard. We also decided to
>make Remote fully self-hostable. Now users can run their complete Lightning
>stack on Start9—Bitcoin node, CLN, and plugin interfaces—entirely on their
>own hardware with intuitive access to advanced features.
>
><cite>—John Gribbin</cite>

Clams [implemented] `BIP-353`, which enables DNS-based Lightning addresses so
users can send payments to email-like addresses. Users can open or close
channels from the interface, adjust invoice visibility, receive sync warnings,
and connect through Tor via Alby proxy. A new "event mode" lets educators and
organizers deploy temporary demo nodes safely.

To support developers, Clams released tools like the [BOLT12 Decoder] and
[detailed documentation] on BOLT12 and BIP-353. Its self-hosted design keeps
node operation verifiable and user-controlled, improving both privacy and
usability within the Lightning ecosystem.

### Cove

[Cove] is a single-signature mobile wallet for on-chain Bitcoin use. Unlike many
wallets that focus on Lightning or multisignature setups, Cove offers a simple,
self-custodial option compatible with hardware signing devices.

OpenSats' [support] helped developer Praveen Perera advance Cove from prototype
to production, releasing it as a non-custodial, Bitcoin-only wallet on the iOS
App Store. Written in `Rust` and integrated through Swift and Kotlin bindings
built on the Bitcoin Development Kit ([BDK]), the app supports [`TAPSIGNER`] and
[`SATSCARD`] hardware cards that let users initialize, change PINs, create
backups, and [sign transactions] directly through NFC.

Beyond Cove itself, Perera contributed upstream improvements to the Rust
ecosystem that make these features possible, including work on [`BIP-329`],
[`rust-cktap`], and [`uniffi`], which powers Rust bindings used by projects like
Cove and `BDK`. These upstream efforts directly strengthen Cove’s functionality
and the broader Bitcoin app ecosystem.

The wallet supports [`BIP-329`] labels, which let users name and organize
transactions for easier tracking. It includes detailed coin control, allowing
users to choose which coins to spend or save for better privacy and fee
management. Custom fee settings and local currency options provide clear
spending control. A decoy PIN mode unlocks a limited version of the wallet under
duress, adding security through plausible deniability.

> Cove isn't doing any one new thing—it's bringing all the right pieces
> together. Coin control on a phone is hard to do well, and I'm proud of how
> usable it turned out.
>
> <cite>—Praveen Perera</cite>

Cove also improved compatibility through [Swift] and [Android] bindings for the
[`BBQr` animated-QR protocol]. This system breaks large transaction files into
scannable QR sequences, allowing air-gapped hardware wallets to sign
transactions offline while keeping private keys isolated. Developers from other
projects, including [Fully Noded], have adopted this method to standardize
offline signing.

Through OpenSats' support, designer Adrian Lischer refined Cove's interface to
make advanced features more approachable. Navigation and transaction flows have
been simplified, and settings now enable switching between basic and advanced
modes.

By combining open-source libraries, hardware integration, and an intuitive user
experience, the project helps advance open Bitcoin development and keeps privacy
and usability in balance. Cove represents a practical evolution in mobile wallet
design, helping new users start safely, while giving experienced users greater
control, and reinforcing open standards that underpin the Bitcoin network.

### Satsigner

[Satsigner] is a Bitcoin wallet that gives users full visibility and control
over their keys, transactions, and signing process. It is designed for users who
want to understand how Bitcoin operates while balancing security with usability.

Through [funding from OpenSats], the project introduced [descriptor-native
multisignature] creation, allowing users to set up shared wallets with
standardized, readable instructions instead of more complex configuration files.
Clear setup flows for `watch-only` and `multisig` wallets make coordination
easier across devices.

Satsigner improved synchronization reliability by integrating an [`Electrum`]
backend with progressive loading and detailed error handling. `QR` and `NFC`
transfer handling now supports multi-part data movement between devices,
reducing errors when signing transactions offline. These changes make it easier
to monitor or update cold storage securely from a mobile phone.

A major update added the transaction graph explorer, which visualizes inputs and
outputs in a [`Sankey`] style flow diagram. This helps users see where coins
come from and where they go, improving understanding of spending patterns and
privacy posture.

Behind the scenes, Satsigner strengthened validation for `descriptor` imports
and exports. The wallet now checks configuration files more carefully for
accuracy and compatibility with other software such as [Sparrow] and [Specter].
Together, these refinements reduce errors during account setup and ensure data
consistency across wallets.

Each release emphasizes transparency and user understanding. By prioritizing
signer-first workflows and making multisignature use practical on mobile
devices, Satsigner reinforces the principles of open verification and personal
control that define Bitcoin self-custody.
