OpenSats is thrilled to announce a commitment from Build Asset Management,
donating 10% of management fees from their bitcoin-backed direct lending
fund, [Build Secured Income Fund
I](https://getbuilding.com/private-credit/build-secured-income-fund-i/), to
support open-source bitcoin development.

This generous donation, provided with
no strings attached and on a monthly basis, will support open-source Bitcoin
development, with funds split equally between OpenSats and the [Human Rights
Foundation's Bitcoin Development Fund](https://hrf.org/devfund). This initiative
underscores efforts to promote financial freedom and economic empowerment
through open-source technology.

> Bitcoin is advancing financial freedom and economic empowerment for
> individuals from the bottom up, across the globe, on an open and level playing
> field. We are committed to supporting its continued development for a brighter
> future, and these two organizations exhibit remarkable leadership and track
> records through their work in this area.

We extend our gratitude to Build Asset Management for their trust and
generosity. Their support is crucial as we continue to give grants to high-impact
projects within the bitcoin and broader open-source ecosystem. As a 501(c)(3)
public charity, we rely on the generosity of the public and organizations like
Build Asset Management to sustain ourselves in pursuit of [our
mission](/mission).

> As Bitcoin continues to gain traction and financial legitimacy in the US and
> other developed nations, it is heartening to see businesses being incentivized

> Fund will have a meaningful impact by advancing Bitcoin and financial
> inclusion for individuals in less developed and authoritarian countries.
