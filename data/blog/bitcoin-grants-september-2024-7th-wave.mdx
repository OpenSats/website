We are excited to announce our seventh wave of grants from our General Fund,
furthering our commitment to supporting open-source projects that advance the
Bitcoin ecosystem. We remain committed to empowering developers from around the
world who are building innovative tools, improving user experience, and
strengthening the overall security and privacy of Bitcoin.

This wave gives grants to eight more projects, each playing a pivotal role in
enhancing various aspects of the Bitcoin ecosystem. In no particular order,
these projects are:

- [Kyoto](#kyoto)
- [Minibits](#minibits)
- [DLC Dev Kit](#dlc-dev-kit)
- [Cove](#cove)
- [Nutmix](#nutmix)
- [ASmap](#asmap)
- [Floresta](#floresta)
- [AssumeUTXO in BCA](#assumeutxo-in-bca)

Thanks to the generosity of our donors, we are able to fund projects that push
the boundaries of what's possible while addressing key priorities in Bitcoin's
development. If you want to join us in supporting projects like the above,
consider donating to our [General Fund](/funds/general):

Let's take a closer look at these projects to discover their purpose and impact,
and see what they bring to the Bitcoin ecosystem.

### Kyoto

[Kyoto](https://github.com/rustaceanrob/kyoto/blob/master/doc/DETAILS.md) is a
Rust-based light client that implements block filters
([BIP-157](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0157.mediawiki)/[BIP-158](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0158.mediawiki))
and is aiming to be a simple, memory-conservative, and private Bitcoin client
for developers to build wallet applications. The goal for Kyoto is to run on
mobile devices with a low-enough memory footprint to allow users to interact
with Lightning Network applications; it is also aspiring to be a client that is
easy to maintain.

The main [developer of Kyoto](https://github.com/rustaceanrob) is also
contributing to
[BDK](https://github.com/bitcoindevkit/bdk/blob/master/README.md), helping to
push it towards its [1.0.0
milestone](https://github.com/orgs/bitcoindevkit/projects/14). This work
includes improving coin selection strategies, assisting in the development of a
Swift-based iOS wallet, and contributing code examples and documentation to make
integrating with Bitcoin easier for developers. He also works on maintaining and
expanding
[BIP-324](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0324.mediawiki), a
bitcoin improvement proposal that enables encrypted peer-to-peer messaging
between Bitcoin clients. This proposal strengthens privacy and censorship
resistance by protecting P2P messages from network observers and ISP-level
censorship, with ongoing integration into Rust clients like
[Floresta](https://github.com/vinteumorg/Floresta/blob/master/README.md).

### Minibits

[Minibits](https://www.minibits.cash/) is a mobile Cashu wallet that integrates
Bitcoin and the Lightning Network, offering a seamless payment experience
through ecash, Lightning addresses, zaps, and Nostr identities. Key features
include seed-based recovery, Tor network support, LNURL pay and withdraw, and
encrypted push notifications. The next development phase focuses on iOS support,
enhanced security, and improved interoperability with the latest ecash and
Lightning technologies. As a fully open-source wallet, Minibits plays an
important role in advancing the [Cashu](https://cashu.space/) protocol by
providing a fast cross-platform mobile wallet which will put Cashu's scalability
and privacy claims to the test in real-world scenarios.

### DLC Dev Kit

[DLC Dev Kit](https://www.dlcdevkit.com/) is a comprehensive development kit
that simplifies the integration of Discreet Log Contracts (DLCs) into Bitcoin
applications, allowing developers to create financial contracts like futures and
peer-to-peer bets without having to deal with the complexities of DLC logic
directly. By providing libraries for wallet operations, DLC communication, data
storage, and integration of oracles, `dlcdevkit` enables seamless application
development. Future work includes launching a platform-agnostic DLC marketplace,
implementing WASM and mobile bindings for broader accessibility, and integrating
covenant support to improve the efficiency of DLCs. These enhancements aim to
foster a more cohesive and interoperable DLC ecosystem, driving broader adoption
and enabling developers to build innovative Bitcoin applications with minimal
friction.

### Cove

Cove is a mobile wallet built with [BDK](https://github.com/bitcoindevkit/bdk/blob/master/README.md). Designed for simplicity and
accessibility, it provides strong support for and integrates seamlessly with
hardware signing devices, making it suitable for beginners and experienced users
alike. The wallet includes features such as PSBT support via NFC, QR codes, and
virtual drives for secure offline signing while offering advanced options like
coin control and watch-only wallets. Future development will focus on expanding
to iOS and Android platforms, and refining the user experience through
real-world user feedback. By providing intuitive access to advanced security
features, Cove seeks to empower users to adopt safer bitcoin practices,
especially when it comes to holding and using bitcoin in a self-sovereign way.

### Nutmix

[Nutmix](https://cashumints.space/cashu-mint/nutmix/) is a Cashu mint
implementation focused on ease of use and feature completeness, making it the
second most advanced mint after Nutshell. Like all proper Chaumian mint
implementations, Nutmix allows custodians to hold funds securely and privately,
without knowing how users choose to spend their money. By helping to diversify
mint implementations, Nutmix offers mint operators more options, reducing
systemic risk and thus bringing us closer to an ecash-based free banking system.

Upcoming development plans include an admin dashboard for easy configuration,
multi-path payments, CLN support, as well as liquidity management features.
Additional milestones on the roadmap include deterministic secrets
([NUT-13](https://github.com/cashubtc/nuts/blob/main/13.md)), HTLCs
([NUT-14](https://github.com/cashubtc/nuts/blob/main/14.md)), a streamlined
setup process, Tor-only mode, as well as a nostr-only mode.

### ASmap

[ASmap](https://asmap.org/) is a project focused on mapping IP address blocks to
their Autonomous Systems (AS) to enhance Bitcoin Core's defense against [eclipse
attacks](https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/eclipse-attacks/) by preventing nodes
from being overly connected to peers controlled by a single entity. By improving
the accuracy and performance of ASmap generation, ASmap helps Bitcoin Core better manage
peer distribution at the AS level, reducing the risk of network attacks. [Future
efforts](https://github.com/fjahr/kartograf/issues/11) include optimizing the
[Kartograf](https://github.com/fjahr/kartograf) ("IP to ASN mapping for everyone") tool, improving data sources,
and making ASmap generation faster and more accessible. This work strengthens
Bitcoin Core's security while offering a valuable tool for other Bitcoin implementations or distributed
systems projects.

### Floresta

[Floresta](https://docs.getfloresta.sh/floresta/) is a modular Bitcoin node
implementation written in Rust. It utilizes Utreexo and PoW Fraud Proofs to
enable a more trustless and decentralized network. By offering fast
synchronization, Floresta aims to make Bitcoin nodes more accessible globally,
reducing reliance on trusted third parties. Its modular design allows for the
development of new applications, and with the integration of the Bitcoin Core consensus
engine via Rust bindings, it mitigates risks of consensus disparity. Upcoming
work includes completing comprehensive documentation and making significant
contributions to improve the node's design, testing, and performance. Floresta's
development promises to enhance the trustless nature of Bitcoin applications and
further decentralize the network.

### AssumeUTXO in BCA

[AssumeUTXO](https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/assumeutxo/) is a feature
introduced in Bitcoin Core 26 that allows for faster node bootstrapping using
UTXO snapshots. This project aims to integrate `AssumeUTXO` functionality into
the [Bitcoin Core App](https://bitcoincore.app/) (BCA), simplifying the process
of deploying Bitcoin nodes on mobile devices, particularly Android. By enabling
users to run fully validating nodes via UTXO snapshots, this integration will
improve the security and decentralization of the Bitcoin network while making it
more accessible. Over the next 6 to 12 months, the project plans to deliver a
proof-of-concept, integrate `AssumeUTXO` into BCA, and provide UX improvements
and documentation updates.
