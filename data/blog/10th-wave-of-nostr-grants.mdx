summary: "OpenSats is funding seven more open-source projects advancing the nostr ecosystem."
---

We're excited to introduce our latest wave of grants, supporting seven
innovative projects that showcase the growing versatility of the nostr
ecosystem.

This round features four first-time grant recipients working on
censorship-resistant group communication, a decentralized app store,
interoperability tools, and hypermedia infrastructure—each expanding the
boundaries of what's possible on nostr. It also includes renewed support for
three projects advancing private group messaging, Lightning payments via nostr,
and modular client experiences.

The four first-time project grants in this wave are:

- [Chachi](#chachi)
- [Zapstore](#zapstore)
- [HyperNote](#hypernote)
- [Nostr Epoxy](#nostr-epoxy)

In addition, OpenSats has renewed project grants for:

- [futr](/blog/7th-wave-of-nostr-grants#futr)
- [Npub.cash](/blog/nostr-grants-july-2024#npubcash)
- [Notedeck](/blog/7th-wave-of-nostr-grants#notedeck)

Our ability to support these projects is made possible by the generosity of our
donors. If you would like to help us continue funding important advancements
within the nostr ecosystem, please consider making a donation to The Nostr Fund.

Let's dive in and learn about how each project is contributing to the future of
nostr.

### Chachi
​[Chachi](https://chachi.chat/) is a relay-based group client implementing
[NIP-29](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/29.md), designed to
facilitate mobile-friendly communication across various content types. By
leveraging open standards like nostr for communications and Blossom for file
hosting, chachi empowers communities—such as open-source projects, meetups,
and topic-based groups—to choose where to store their messages and files,
ensuring interoperability and freeing users from client or server lock-in. The
platform supports diverse content, including text notes, long-form content,
polls, highlights, and custom emojis, with plans to incorporate video, audio,
wikis, and calendar events.​

With the support of this grant, chachi aims to enhance its feature set by
implementing synchronized unread state across clients, introducing a
comprehensive notifications section, and enabling
[NIP-17](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/17.md) direct
messages with unread state synchronization. Additional planned developments
include refined group administration tools, enriched user profiles, Progressive
Web App (PWA) capabilities for mobile installation, multiple login methods
([NIP-46](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/46.md),
[NIP-55](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/55.md), and
read-only with
[NIP-05](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/05.md)), improved
onboarding, and bitcoin integration features such as sending
[Zaps](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/57.md) and displaying
Zaps in posts and chats. These advancements are set to further chachi's mission
of providing decentralized, user-centric communication solutions.

### Zapstore
[Zapstore](https://zapstore.dev/) is a decentralized, permissionless app store
built on nostr to give developers and users greater
control over their software experience. By allowing developers to
cryptographically sign their releases and publish them via nostr events and
relays, Zapstore ensures censorship-resistant distribution. Users can verify
binaries before installation and engage with the social discovery
layer—recommending apps, following trusted developers, and zapping
value-for-value bitcoin payments directly. Zapstore supports Tor usage,
account-less operation, and local-first architecture, making it fast, private,
and usable even offline or with poor connectivity. A command-line tool
(`zapstore-cli`) enables developers to publish apps and act as a package manager
across platforms like Mac and Linux.

With the support of this grant, efforts will focus on enhancing user-friendly
app and relay management tools, supporting a wider variety of DVMs, and
fostering a more diverse ecosystem of relays. On the social side, features like
ratings, comments, and curated app packs will improve discovery and engagement.
The project also plans to extend support to MacOS, Linux, and potentially PWAs,
while continuing to develop UX improvements for developers, including
self-signing workflows and bunker support. Further goals include integrating
with package ecosystems like Homebrew via proxy relays and advancing the open
app NIP spec to encourage third-party participation. Through these initiatives,
Zapstore hopes to reduce developer dependence on big tech and foster a thriving,
open-source app economy.

### HyperNote
[HyperNote](https://www.hypernote.club) is a protocol for applications to
interpret [hypermedia](https://hypermedia.systems/hypermedia-a-reintroduction/)
on nostr. Embracing the "dumb relay, smart client" design philosophy, HyperNote
stores HTML-like content and interactions as events on relays, while state is
maintained, reconstructed, and interpreted by clients. Much like how hypermedia
builds expressiveness on top of the web's stable foundations, HyperNote adds
rich interactivity to nostr without requiring changes to the underlying
protocol.

With the support of this grant, the project aims to lower the barrier to entry
for developers building applications on the HyperNote framework. HyperNote plans
to create a reference implementation using the Raylib library and the Zig
programming language, and a webview integration to make it easy for existing
nostr clients to integrate Hypernote. In addition, they aim to rebuild existing
applications including Guestbook, DVM Chess, and Slideshow, as well as launch a
new "Instagram Stories" application. Through these efforts, HyperNote seeks to
catalyze nostr's own Geocities/MySpace moment—reviving the open, expressive
ethos of the early web.

### Nostr Epoxy
Nostr Epoxy is a nostr-based paid WebSocket proxy that allows users to connect
to relays and other WebSocket services, such as [Cashu
mints](https://docs.cashu.space/mints). Whether hampered by network
restrictions, censorship, or infrastructure limitations, Nostr Epoxy enables
connectivity by acting as a bridge between different networks, including Tor,
I2P, and Hyper. By integrating in-band Cashu payments, it also incentivizes
proxy operators to maintain reliable infrastructure, fostering a more resilient
and decentralized ecosystem.

With the support of this grant, Nostr Epoxy aims to further develop its
capabilities by implementing features such as random message delays to mitigate
timing attacks, deploying globally distributed proxies in regions like North
America, South America, Europe, and Asia, and encrypting all messages to ensure
end-to-end security. These advancements will enhance user privacy, improve
network scalability, and reduce reliance on traditional DNS and SSL protocols,
contributing to a more open and censorship-resistant internet.

As nostr continues to evolve beyond a simple relay-based protocol into a
foundational layer for decentralized identity, communication, and financial
transactions, the importance of supporting innovative projects that push the
boundaries of possibility becomes clearer than ever.

Our ability to foster these advancements depends on the generosity of
donors—if you'd like to help drive Nostr's growth, consider making a donation
to The Nostr Fund.
