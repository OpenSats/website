It's been only a few short months since the OpenSats LTS program was
[introduced](https://opensats.org/blog/announcing-lts-grant-program-to-support-bitcoin-core-contributors),
so we are incredibly pleased that developers are taking note and our list of
OpenSats LTS grantees keeps growing.

Please join us in welcoming our newest grantee, [Gleb
Naumenko](https://github.com/naumenkogs). Gleb has been active in the Bitcoin
Core repository since 2018,
[contributing](https://bitcoinacks.com/?flt0_author_contains=naumenkogs) to and
[reviewing](https://bitcoinacks.com/?flt0_reviewer_contains=naumenkogs) various
features and code improvements ever since. His focus, both as a researcher and
as a developer, lies mostly on the P2P aspects of Bitcoin Core.

The two most significant projects he is working on right now are
[Erlay](https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/erlay/) and
[asmap](https://dunxen.dev/asmap/). As the author of several [research
papers](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=gleb+naumenko) considering Bitcoin
and Lightning security—some of which gathered considerable interest in the
community—he is well-positioned to work on the peer-to-peer side of both
networks.

Support from OpenSats will allow Gleb to push the various [Erlay
PRs](https://bitcoinacks.com/?flt0_author_contains=naumenkogs&search=Erlay)
forward, facilitating reviewers with necessary feedback, as well as rebasing PRs
and managing reviews. Aside from his work on Erlay, he will continue to work on
reviewing other big projects like [v3 transaction
relay](https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/version-3-transaction-relay/), [package
relay](https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/package-relay/), and the
[addrman](https://doxygen.bitcoincore.org/class_addr_man.html) rework.

We love to see our LTS program gaining traction. To quote
[@jamesob](https://opensats.org/about/jamesob): "Keeping a contributor like Gleb
involved for the long term is the kind of thing that OpenSats was started to
do."
