We are excited to announce the sixth wave of Bitcoin grants, reaffirming our
commitment to supporting freedom tech and projects that help Bitcoin flourish.
An important part of our mission is to provide essential funding to developers
and projects that advance the open-source ecosystem that Bitcoin relies upon.

In this latest round, we are proud to support eight projects that align with our
mission. In no particular order, these projects are:

- [secp256k1.swift](#secp256k1swift)
- [Blitz Wallet](#blitz-wallet)
- [NLightning](#nlightning)
- [Bitcoin Fees](#bitcoin-fees)
- [eNuts](#enuts)
- [Gonuts](#gonuts)
- [Peer Storage Backups for Lightning Channels](#peer-storage-backups-for-lightning-channels)
- [Bitcoin Jungle](#bitcoin-jungle)

Made possible by the generosity of our donors, these grants enable the various
contributors to continue and expand their important work. If you would like to
support [our mission](/mission), then please consider donating to our [General
Fund](/funds/general):

### secp256k1.swift

Secp256k1.swift provides public key cryptography solutions for Bitcoin
applications in Swift. It simplifies cryptographic operations by offering tools
for generating private keys and APIs for features like ECDSA and Schnorr
signatures. By utilizing C bindings from
[libsecp256k1](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1), it enhances the
efficiency of Bitcoin app development, fostering innovation and supporting the
creation of non-custodial, decentralized applications.

The grant will support launching a project website, developing Swift APIs for
MuSig2 and native UInt256 type, adding an XCFramework artifact for cross
platform integration, and establishing the [21.dev](https://21.dev/)
organization to support future projects. These initiatives aim to expand the
project's capabilities and promote broader adoption and innovation within the
community.

### Blitz Wallet

[Blitz Wallet](https://blitz-wallet.com/) is a self-custodial Bitcoin Lightning
wallet leveraging Breez SDK and Blockstream Greenlight for its infrastructure.
It integrates features like automatic channel rebalancing, smart channel
openings via Boltz, a built-in store for spending sats on applications like
ChatGPT, and enhanced contact features for mass payments and payment requests.

The grant will support integrating a Liquid wallet, improving user experience
with the built-in store and contact features, and launching iOS and Android apps
(both currently in Beta). The project aims to create an all-encompassing
Lightning wallet experience, addressing inbound liquidity issues and providing
users with practical ways to spend Bitcoin and simplify transactions.

### NLightning

[NLightning](https://nlightning.ipms.io/) is an implementation of the Lightning
Network protocol developed in C#, aimed at enhancing Bitcoin scalability and
adoption in enterprise systems. The project provides a robust, secure, and
easy-to-integrate solution for bringing Bitcoin blockchain technology into
traditional financial environments. It follows a modular design, making it easy
to extend and customize.

The grant will support completing the implementation of [BOLT
specifications](https://nlightning.ipms.io/docs/features.html), launching
comprehensive documentation and tutorials, developing additional tools for
monitoring and managing Lightning Network transactions for enterprise use, and
piloting NLightning with financial institutions.

### Bitcoin Fees

Bitcoin Fees aims to create a cross-platform, open-source app that tracks
on-chain fees and notifies users of specified fee changes. The app helps users
understand UTXOs and provides a fee calculator to educate users about Bitcoin
transaction fees.

The grant will support developing a proof-of-concept beta version of the app,
focusing on tracking fees and educating users on managing Bitcoin transaction
costs.

### eNuts

[eNuts](https://www.enuts.cash/) is a free and open-source mobile
[Cashu](https://docs.cashu.space/) wallet available for Android and iOS,
designed with Lightning support and the ability to connect to multiple mints. It
integrates [nostr](https://nostr.com/) for seamless Ecash transactions between
users and their contacts. The wallet aims to enhance user experience by making
Ecash payments easier and safer, providing features like detailed transaction
history, various mint settings, quick share options, and enhanced privacy
settingsâ€‹.

The grant will support the release of APK and Testflight versions, enhance its
nostr integration, add proper UI testing, and improve the maintainability of the
codebase. This funding will also facilitate the addition of features like seed
backup, auto mint-swap, and an improved user experience.

### Gonuts

Gonuts is a Cashu wallet and mint written in [Go](https://go.dev/), serving as a
library for developers to integrate Cashu functionality into their Go
applications. This project aims to simplify the implementation of
privacy-preserving ecash transactions within the Bitcoin and Lightning Network
ecosystems, making it easier for developers to incorporate these features into
their own applications.

The grant will support several key developments for Gonuts by implementing new
protocol additions such as Spending Conditions and Pay to Public Key (as
outlined in NUTs [10](https://github.com/cashubtc/nuts/blob/main/10.md) and
[11](https://github.com/cashubtc/nuts/blob/main/11.md)), enabling "Multinut"
payments to allow users to pay a Lightning invoice from multiple mints, and
improving mint reliability by adding support for
[SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/).

Additionally, the grant will facilitate the creation of a [Docker
container](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container/) for easier mint
deployment and extend support to other Lightning backends beyond LND. These
enhancements will make Gonuts more robust, versatile, and user-friendly,
fostering broader adoption and innovation within the Cashu ecosystem.

### Peer Storage Backups for Lightning Channels

Peer Storage Backups for Lightning Channels focuses on creating an automated
backup solution for the Lightning Network, enabling fund recovery in case of
data loss. The project aims to enhance the reliability of the Lightning Network
by developing a seamless recovery process for users to retrieve funds from
corrupted databases using only their initial passphrase.

The grant will support automating peer storage backup detection, creating
mechanisms for nodes to advertise backup support, and preparing a Lightning-spec
proposal for peer storage backups. These efforts will make backups automatic and
universally compatible across different implementations. The project will also
research methods to resume channel operations post-recovery and explore
additional use cases for peer storage.

### Bitcoin Jungle

Bitcoin Jungle is an open-source community project in Costa Rica focused on
creating a circular Bitcoin economy. The project provides Bitcoin education,
resources, and technology to individuals and businesses, aiming to simplify the
transition to a Bitcoin-based economy and protect businesses' balance sheets
from inflation.

This grant will enhance their Bitcoin point-of-sale system and wallet
infrastructure, conduct educational workshops, create educational materials,
hire local Costa Ricans for tech support and community outreach, and support
local initiatives that benefit the community.
