OpenSats is thrilled to announce a $250,000 donation from the Human Rights
Foundation's Bitcoin Development Fund, first
[announced](https://hrf.org/latest/hrf-bitcoin-development-fund-grants-one-billion-satoshis-to-13-projects-worldwide/)
during the 2024 Oslo Freedom Forum.

The Human Rights Foundation ([HRF](https://hrf.org/)) defends global human
rights by supporting dissidents and challenging authoritarian regimes, and their
[Bitcoin Development
Fund](https://hrf.org/program/financial-freedom/bitcoin-development-fund/) backs
projects that enhance Bitcoin's privacy, security, and usability to promote
global financial freedom.

This generous contribution is specifically allocated for our [Operations
Budget](/funds/ops), ensuring our essential operational functions remain robust
and effective.

> OpenSats is a powerful force for good in the world. Their largely
> volunteer-driven team has an outsized impact, and HRF is thrilled to support
> their important work with this grant to help sustain their operations.

Unlike our General Fund and The Nostr Fund, which pass 100% of donations
directly to developers and projects, the Operations Budget is what sustains the
organizational framework that makes our grantmaking possible. This funding
empowers us to continue our behind-the-scenes work, which keeps our
[mission](/mission) thriving.

We are grateful to HRF for their trust and support. If you share our commitment
to fostering open-source development in the Bitcoin and nostr ecosystems, please
consider donating to our cause. Your support drives
meaningful innovation and helps us champion the technologies of tomorrow.
