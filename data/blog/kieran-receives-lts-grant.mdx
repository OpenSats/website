OpenSats is excited to announce long-term support for another prolific nostr
developer, [Kieran Harkin](https://github.com/v0l).

Kieran is renowned for his work on [snort.social](https://snort.social/), a
web-based nostr client, and [zap.stream](https://zap.stream/), a pioneering live
stream and video platform built on nostr with the ability for audiences to
directly "[zap](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/57.md)"
bitcoin to live streamers. He is also the creator of the
[void.cat](https://void.cat/) media hosting service.

Long-term support will help Kieran to focus on several key enhancements for his
existing projects, including:

- Performance improvements for snort.social and zap.stream
- Developing native applications for zap.stream
- New zap.stream backend to create a marketplace of streaming providers

> The primary goal with Snort and zap.stream is to make decentralized social
> media and streaming more accessible, ensuring censorship resistance with user
> control, while allowing content creators to monetize their work directly with
> their audience using Bitcoin
