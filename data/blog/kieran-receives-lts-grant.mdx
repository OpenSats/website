OpenSats is excited to announce long-term support for another prolific nostr
developer, [Kieran Harkin](https://github.com/v0l).

Kieran is renowned for his work on [snort.social](https://snort.social/), a
web-based nostr client, and [zap.stream](https://zap.stream/), a pioneering live
stream and video platform built on nostr with the ability for audiences to
directly "[zap](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/57.md)"
bitcoin to live streamers; he is also the creator behind
[void.cat](http://void.cat), a decentralized media hosting service.

This LTS grant will help Kieran achieve several key enhancements for his
existing projects, including:

- Developing native iOS and Android apps for snort.social
- Introducing SnortDeck, a TweetDeck-like UI for advanced user management
- Expanding [zap.stream](https://zap.stream/) features, such as rankings and viewer/user stats
- Improving backend infrastructure for better user experience (UX) and scalability

> The primary goal with Snort and zap.stream is to make decentralized social
> media and streaming more accessible, ensuring censorship resistance with user
> control, while allowing content creators to monetize their work directly with
> their audience using Bitcoin
