OpenSats is delighted to announce an LTS grant for Shashwat Vangani who hails
from India.

Shashwat is a 2021 alumni from the [Summer of
Bitcoin](https://www.summerofbitcoin.org/) founded by Adi Shankara and commenced
his development journey on Bitcoin by working on Bitcoin Core focused on a new
reactive version of Bitcoin-QT. This subsequently took him to [Saving
Satoshi](https://savingsatoshi.com/) which helps new developers learn about how
Bitcoin works. Most recently, Shashwat has focused on Lightning and has been
contributing to the [Lightning Development Kit](https://lightningdevkit.org/)
(LDK).

This LTS grant will enable Shashwat to focus on the deployment of BOLT-12 within
LDK, with a particular focus on blinded paths, invoice overpayments, and
retrying invoice requests. The integration of [BOLT-12](https://bolt12.org/)
expands the breadth of LDK as a full implementation of the Lightning
specification, which in aggregate, contributes to improving the reliability and
functionality of the Lightning Network.

> Working on LDK is a dream come true for me. Using a programming language that
> has become my first love over time, alongside a team who shares my passion and
> often exceeds it in their excitement, support, and kindness, towards building an
> actual meaningful project that I truly care about. What more could one ask for?
