We are pleased to share that OpenSats has received $200,000 from [StarkWare] and
an additional $200,000 from the [Starknet Foundation], for a total of $400,000
directed to our [General Fund].

OpenSats is a 501(c)(3) public charity that supports a sustainable ecosystem of
funding for free and open-source projects and their contributors. 100% of
donations to [our funds] go to free and open-source projects. Administrative and
operational expenses are covered separately through our [Operations Budget].

StarkWare and the Starknet Foundation [share a commitment] to building open,
censorship-resistant, and privacy-preserving systems, connecting this work to
the long-term health of Bitcoin’s open-source foundation. They highlighted the
role nonprofit funding plays in enabling developers, researchers, educators, and
maintainers to do sustained work on infrastructure that everyone depends on.

Our General Fund helps support work across the Bitcoin ecosystem, including
protocol and wallet development, Lightning improvements, developer tooling,
technical documentation, education, and other public infrastructure that
strengthens the ecosystem long-term.

We are grateful to StarkWare and the Starknet Foundation for their support and
for publicly affirming the importance of funding open-source work.

If you share our commitment to free and open-source software for Bitcoin and
freedom tech, you can support OpenSats by donating to one of our funds.
