OpenSats is pleased to announce a new long-term support (LTS) program for
Bitcoin Core developers and similar Load-Bearing Internet People.[^fn-lbip] This grant
program is designed to provide financial support for developers who are working
on critical infrastructure for the bitcoin network.

The LTS program is a new initiative from OpenSats and is distinct from our
regular grant program, which is more expansive in scope. It is also distinct
from OpenSats' website listings, which allows reviewed open-source projects to
directly receive additional donations. The LTS program is specifically
designed to provide long-term support for developers who are working on critical
open-source infrastructure in and around bitcoin.

Having a longer time horizon than regular grants, the LTS program is geared
towards long-term stability for grantees, with a minimum grant duration of 12
months and possible grant durations of two years or longer. This will allow
developers to focus on their work without having to worry about financial
constraints.

To be eligible for the LTS program, applicants must:

- have a track record of quality contributions
- be mission-driven and self-motivated
- be able to [work in public](https://bitcoin-resources.com/books/working-in-public)
- be bitcoin-only

Applications for the LTS program are now open: [https://opensats.org/apply/][apply]

The first recipient of an OpenSats LTS Grant is Marco Falke, a long-term
maintainer and contributor of Bitcoin Core with [thousands of contributions][pulls] over
many years. Marco will continue to focus on testing and quality assurance, as
well as maintenance and review, helping to make sure that the Bitcoin Core
software is as solid as it can be. You can read more about his contributions
[here][bm].

We appreciate all the hard work that goes into building and maintaining critical
open-source infrastructure. It is a hard and often thankless job. We hope that
we can play a role in [closing the gaps in bitcoin open-source funding][gaps], and we
look forward to working with contributors in the future.

OpenSats aims to be an additional pillar of the increasingly solid funding
landscape in and around bitcoin. We have learned a lot from the programs of the
past and aim to join Brink, Spiral, Chaincode, HRF, and other successful grant
programs to support those who build the tools that ensure the protection of
individual liberties in our digital world.

We are committed to supporting the development of bitcoin. The LTS program is a
new way for OpenSats to support long-term contributors who are building,
maintaining, testing, researching, and reviewing critical software.

We encourage all qualified developers to [apply for the LTS program][apply].
Together, we can build a stronger and more resilient bitcoin network.
