We are excited to announce long-term support for our newest grantee, Bruno
Garcia.

Bruno is from Brazil, where in the '90s, a president executed a savings rug-pull
on the entire population in an attempt to "fix inflation," a move that turned
out to be a history lesson that ultimately nudged him towards Bitcoin. In 2021,
he started contributing to Bitcoin core, hosting local Bitdevs meetups, and
received a grant from [Vinteum](https://vinteum.org) where he is now the
Director of Education.

Over the past two years, his work has stood out in numerous pull requests, where
he's tested, reviewed, and improved the codeâ€”tackling bugs, rolling out new
features, and working hard to make the Bitcoin network more resilient. He has
also been working on fuzz testing by adding more targets and improving the
existing ones.

He is also the creator of `bitcoinfuzz`, a differential fuzzing tool essential
for detecting bugs within Bitcoin libraries and implementations, and is
contributing to [ASMap](https://asmap.org/), a feature designed to fortify the Bitcoin network's
resilience by encouraging nodes to diversify their connections across various
Autonomous Systems. Our LTS grant will now help him to work, among other things,
on making `ASMap` default in Bitcoin Core.

Beyond technical contributions, he plays a vital role in mentoring the next
generation of Bitcoin developers through initiatives such as the [Summer of
Bitcoin](https://www.summerofbitcoin.org/mentors). This LTS grant supports his
technical projects along with his efforts to share knowledge.

Bruno is currently prepping for a marathon, applying the same low-time
preference to his running as he does to Bitcoin: focusing on the long haul.
Being adept at handling the challenges that come with being a [load-bearing
internet person][lbip], this marathon is just another run in the park for him.

All of our grant programs are made possible thanks to the kindness of our
amazing donors. Thinking about pitching in? We'd love for you to consider making
a donation. Every bit helps us keep this initiative going. Thanks for keeping
Bitcoin and open-source development strong.
