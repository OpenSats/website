---

OpenSats is proud to announce long-term support for fiatjaf, the original brain behind nostr.

Before nostr, fiatjaf's primary focus was on decentralized financial systems and tools for Bitcoin's Lightning Network, 
having contributed to projects like [lntxbot](https://github.com/fiatjaf/lntxbot), [c-lightning](https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning/commits?author=fiatjaf), 
[lnbits](https://github.com/lnbits/lnbits/commits?author=fiatjaf), and creating [LNURL tools](https://github.com/fiatjaf/go-lnurl), to name a few.

When he is not writing inflammatory posts about how everybody is wrong, he spends his time tirelessly enhancing the [nostr](https://nostr.com/) ecosystem he pioneered.

This LTS grant will enable fiatjaf to focus all his time and attention on nostr and his many ongoing projects, such as 
[nostr-tools](https://github.com/nbd-wtf/nostr-tools), [nos2x](https://github.com/fiatjaf/nos2x), [go-nostr](https://github.com/nbd-wtf/go-nostr), 
[khatru](https://github.com/fiatjaf/khatru), [eventstore](https://github.com/fiatjaf/eventstore), [njump](https://njump.me/about), [loure](https://github.com/fiatjaf/loure), 
[wikistr](https://github.com/fiatjaf/wikistr), [patch34](https://github.com/fiatjaf/patch34), [nak](https://github.com/fiatjaf/nak), [gitstr](https://github.com/fiatjaf/gitstr), 
[song](https://git.fiatjaf.com/song), [mmm](https://git.fiatjaf.com/mmm), and [promenade](https://git.fiatjaf.com/promenade). These tools and frameworks are aimed at improving the 
development of nostr clients, building custom relays, and enhancing the overall nostr infrastructureâ€‹.

Additionally, fiatjaf will begin several new initiatives aimed at enhancing user experience, bolstering network resilience, and offering competitive alternatives to existing solutions. 
These projects include:

-   NIP-29 GTK4 desktop client
-   Custom relays using khatru and mmm
-   A competing solution to [Ditto](https://ditto.pub/)

Our mission at OpenSats is to provide sustainable funding for those who work on the freedom tech of tomorrow. We believe that free and open-source software tools in general, and 
Bitcoin and nostr in particular, are essential to the future of the internet and the world.

LTS grants are awarded to individuals or projects making significant contributions to the open-source ecosystem within Bitcoin and nostr, and we are excited to extend our support 
to such a remarkable and prolific developer.

The [Long-Term Support program](/blog/nostr-lts-long-term-support-for-nostr-developers) is made possible by generous donors like you. To help us continue supporting important 
open-source contributors like fiatjaf, consider making a donation to [The Nostr Fund](/funds/nostr).
