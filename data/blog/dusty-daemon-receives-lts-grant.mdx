---

OpenSats is excited to announce long-term support for the creator
behind Splicing on the Lightning Network, [Dusty
Daemon](https://github.com/ddustin). Dusty has contributed significantly to the
Lightning Network [specifications](https://github.com/lightning/bolts/pull/863)
and the design and implementation of Splicing.

[Splicing](https://lightningsplice.com/splicing_explained.html) enhances the
usability of the Lightning Network by allowing users to modify channel sizes
instead of having to close and create new channels when size changes are
required. This reduces the on-chain transactions required and improves the
usability of the Lightning Network.

With LTS support from OpenSats, Dusty will help extend the Splicing
implementation across the Lightning ecosystem and commence building
[Splice Script](https://www.youtube.com/live/nXbjP2TSajE?t=849s). This new
toolset will provide a straightforward mechanism for users and application
developers to utilize Splicing in more complex ways. The expected outcomes
include further reductions in on-chain transactions, improved transactional
privacy and simplified in-channel and on-chain interaction.

>The euphoria I get from contributing to something as important as I believe
>Lightning is, is incredible ⸻ I'd trade all those lost savings and sleepless
>nights for it all over again.
