# Progress Report

(January \- November 2025\)

**1\. Key milestones/activities completed in 2025**

* Executed grantmaking cycles across our programs (Bitcoin, nostr, and Education), issuing new grants and renewing support for existing grantees.  
    
* Formed a dedicated [ecash committee](https://opensats.org/selection#our-process-for-reviewing-grant-proposals) to strengthen domain expertise and improve application and report review in this domain.  
    
* Published [impact reporting](https://opensats.org/tags/impact) summarizing funded work and progress across key focus areas; continued announcements of [grant waves](https://opensats.org/tags/wave) and individual [long-term support grants](https://opensats.org/tags/lts).  
    
* Improved accountability and grant operations by tightening reporting expectations and enforcement to better manage follow-through and reduce risk from stalled or underperforming grants.  
    
* Built internal web dashboards for the ops team and board to manage grant intake, review/voting, and reporting compliance (including flagging overdue/problematic reports).  
    
* Launched a site-wide [recurring donation flow](https://opensats.org/monthly) and added recurring donation calls-to-action across announcements and key pages for more predictable, long-term funding.  
    
* Maintained and expanded transparency by continuing to publish financial statements and board minutes on the [Transparency page](https://opensats.org/transparency).

**2\. Measurable progress/outputs (e.g., \# of people served, \# of events held)**

* Total number of grants in 2025:   
  * 229 grants (vs. 215 in 2024; \+6.5% YoY) with 116 new and 113 continuing.  
      
* Funding by grant type:  
  * Long-term support (LTS): $3,993,949 (vs. $2,261,131 in 2024; \+77% YoY)  
  * Regular grants: $7,094,729 (vs. $6,906,360 in 2024; \+3% YoY)  
      
* Funding by program fund:  
  * General Fund: $7,878,735 (vs. $5,514,941 in 2024; \+43% YoY)  
  * The Nostr Fund: $3,209,942 (vs. $3,652,550 in 2024; \-12% YoY)

**3\. Early outcomes (i.e. the change you generated; for example, increased knowledge of…, Increased access to…)**

* Improved [privacy and user security on bitcoin’s base layer](https://opensats.org/blog/developing-advancements-in-onchain-privacy) by funding work that moved privacy-enhancing standards and implementations closer to real-world wallet and ecosystem adoption (e.g., [Async Payjoin/Payjoin v2](https://opensats.org/blog/developing-advancements-in-onchain-privacy#async-payjoin) and [Silent Payments](https://opensats.org/blog/developing-advancements-in-onchain-privacy#silent-payments) work, plus supporting libraries and integration tracking).  
    
* [Improved Lightning usability and reliability](https://opensats.org/blog/advancements-in-lightning-infrastructure) by supporting infrastructure work that reduces friction and cost for liquidity management (e.g., [splicing interoperability](https://opensats.org/blog/advancements-in-lightning-infrastructure#splicing) progress and practical tooling like [Splice Script](https://opensats.org/blog/advancements-in-lightning-infrastructure#splicing) integrated into CLN).  
    
* Expanded access to bitcoin developer education and pathways into open-source contribution by supporting training initiatives that translate education into participation and contributions ([OpenSats’ developer training impact reporting](https://opensats.org/blog/advancements-in-developer-training) documents these programs and outcomes).  
    
* Made self-custody more practical and safer for end users by supporting wallet work that reduces reliance on centralized infrastructure and improves user safety (e.g., [direct network-based transaction notifications](https://opensats.org/blog/advancements-in-bitcoin-and-lightning-wallets#bitcoin-safe) and other release-shipped improvements highlighted in [the wallets impact reporting](https://opensats.org/blog/advancements-in-bitcoin-and-lightning-wallets)).  
    
* [Strengthened decentralized communication and value transfer on nostr](https://opensats.org/blog/advancements-in-nostr-clients) by supporting client improvements that make relay use more robust/automatic, private communication stronger, and Lightning “zaps” more usable, paired with ecosystem-level usage signals (e.g., zap totals tracked publicly).  
    
* [Accelerated ecash toward real-world readiness](https://opensats.org/blog/advancements-in-ecash) (including mobile \+ low-connectivity use cases) by supporting protocol implementations and tooling (e.g., [multi-mint payment reliability work in Nutshell](https://opensats.org/blog/advancements-in-ecash#nutshell) and [mobile bindings work in CDK](https://opensats.org/blog/advancements-in-ecash#cashu-dev-kit), as documented in the 2025 ecash impact reporting).
