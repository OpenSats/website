---

We're excited to announce our latest wave of grants supporting projects that
advance the nostr ecosystem, empowering developers to push the boundaries of
privacy, autonomy, and innovative communication.

In this round, we're backing five initiatives focused on enriching user
experience and fostering seamless connectivity within the network. From
developing intuitive user interfaces to enabling robust cross-client
compatibility, these projects embody the spirit of open-source collaboration,
making important contributions to the nostr ecosystem.

The five projects in this funding wave are:

- [Formstr](#formstr)
- [Groups](#groups)
- [Coop](#coop)
- [Nostrability](#nostrability)
- [NIP-44 Libraries Audit](#nip-44-libraries-audit)

Our support for nostr is made possible by the generosity of our donors, with
contributions helping us support innovative projects like these. If you would
like to help us continue supporting nostr, consider donating to [The Nostr
Fund](/funds/nostr):

Let's look at these projects and how they align with our
[mission](/mission).

### Formstr

[Formstr] is a decentralized, self-sovereign forms application built on the
nostr protocol. It aims to offer users an alternative to mainstream platforms
like Google Forms and Typeform, allowing individuals and organizations to manage
their data without dependence on centralized services.  By providing more
control over how data is used and where it is sent, Formstr empowers users with
greater privacy and autonomy.

This grant will be used to enhance Formstr's functionality, focusing on features
such as access-controlled forms with multiple admins, encrypted forms with
selective participation, and logic-based fields responsive to user input. Other
planned improvements include paid surveys, AI integration for more intelligent
form interactions, and compatibility with workflow tools like Notion and Slack.

### Groups

[Groups] is a chat client built on nostr. Leveraging the
[NIP-29](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/29.md) standard, it
supports relay-based group chats with advanced moderation features. Users can
create, join, and manage groups with unique identifiers, where access is
governed by relay-enforced rules. With features like threaded conversations,
event handling, and moderation tools, Groups aims to provide a user-friendly and
robust platform for decentralized group interactions within the nostr ecosystem.

This grant will be used to focus on group management capabilities, user-friendly
interface improvements, and expanded moderation tools. Planned developments
include advanced UI/UX refinements, broader support for NIP-29 actions, and
tools for group-specific events and permissions. Future updates will also
prioritize community feedback to foster an adaptable, collaborative
environmentâ€‹.

### Coop

[Coop] is a messaging client built on nostr, designed for personal and group
communication with a focus on gamers. It offers a Discord-like experience, while
also enabling secure and simple communication through features such as group
chats and threaded discussions with plans for voice and video calls. It
currently runs on desktop platforms (macOS, Windows, and Linux) using
[Tauri](https://tauri.app/start/), with a Rust-based rebuild in progress for
faster performance. Future releases will also include mobile versions for
Android and iOS.

This grant will support Coop's further development, which aims to enhance group
management features, and introduce secret chat functionalities. Upcoming updates
will focus on improving user interface design, boosting app performance,
integrating with third-party tools, and offering better community-building tools
like fundraising options for group owners and interactive bots to assist users.

### Nostrability

[Nostrability] is a documentation project aimed at understanding how various nostr
clients interact with one another. It identifies and documents inconsistencies
and issues in client interactions, such as missing relay lists, vanished
follows, or inconsistent note visibility. Nostrability encourages developers to
address these compatibility issues and improve interoperability across nostr
clients. The project will serve as a comprehensive knowledge base for
troubleshooting, best practices, and fostering collaboration within the nostr
ecosystem.

This grant will support Nostrability's continued efforts to document nostr
client behavior, gather developer feedback, and develop
[nostrCI](https://github.com/nostrCI), an automated testing suite for client
compatibility. Upcoming milestones will also include advocating for new NIPs
that enhance interoperability among nostr clients.

### NIP-44 Libraries Audit

This project aims to secure nostr's encrypted direct messaging and group chat
capabilities by auditing the cryptography libraries underlying the new [NIP-44]
standard. Designed to resolve critical vulnerabilities in the previous NIP-04,
NIP-44 introduces a robust encryption framework, and this independent audit of
the Noble-Ciphers JS implementation will ensure its security and resilience.
This review is a vital step in protecting private communications on nostr.
