summary: "OpenSats is funding six more open-source projects advancing the Bitcoin ecosystem."
---

In this eleventh wave of grants from our General Fund, we're proud to support a
diverse set of contributors advancing Bitcoin's infrastructure, tooling, and
accessibility.

From open-source mining hardware and protocol-level scripting improvements to
peer-to-peer exchange protocols and privacy-preserving payment tools, these
projects are building critical components for a more robust and decentralized
Bitcoin ecosystem.

The three first-time project grants in this wave are:

- [BitShoka](#bitshoka)
- [Great Script Restoration](#great-script-restoration)
- [256 Foundation](#256-foundation)

In addition, OpenSats has renewed project grants for:

- [Payjoin](/blog/bitcoin-grants-july-2023#payjoin-dev-kit)
- [Mostro](/blog/nostr-grants-july-2024#mostro)
- [P2Pool v2](https://github.com/pool2win/p2pool-v2) (evolved from p2pool,
  including [Braidpool](/blog/bitcoin-grants-feb-2024#braidpool))

All of the above grants are sourced from our General Fund, made possible by the
generosity of our donors. Help us support free and open-source projects by

Let's take a closer look at these projects to discover their purpose, impact,
and the value they bring to the Bitcoin ecosystem.

### BitShoka

BitShoka builds on the [BitAxe](/blog/bitcoin-grants-feb-2024#the-bitaxe)
project by focusing on reverse engineering MicroBT ASIC chips. The goal is to
document and implement the communication protocols used in these chips, helping
to make Bitcoin mining more accessible and transparent. Beyond technical
progress, the project is also connected to grassroots efforts to expand mining
globally. In Kenya, members of the African Bitcoin mining community have been
assembling BitAxe devices since December 2024, reflecting a growing interest in
locally-built, open-source mining tools.

With support from this grant, BitShoka will dedicate the next year to decoding
the MicroBT KF1950 ASIC protocol, integrating support into
[ESP-miner](https://github.com/bitaxeorg/ESP-Miner), and producing a new BitAxe
variant that runs on these chips. This work will make MicroBT-based mining
viable for solo miners, especially in regions where durable ASICs are needed to
handle high temperatures or other climate-related challenges.

### Great Script Restoration

Great Script Restoration (GSR) is a research and development project aimed at
reintroducing disabled opcodes to [Bitcoin
Script](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script) in a safe and measured way. These
opcodes were removed early in Bitcoin's history to prevent denial-of-service
(DoS) attacks, but advances in network design make it possible to reconsider
them. GSR proposes a new "Varops" ([Variable
Operations](https://rusty.ozlabs.org/2024/01/19/the-great-opcode-restoration.html))
budget model—similar to [Tapscript's
Sigops](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/100888/how-to-calculate-tapscript-sigops-budget)
limit—to regulate resource use while restoring these capabilities. In
addition, the project explores removing other restrictions, such as limits on
stack element size, to make Script more flexible for developers.

Support from this grant will help GSR progress through the research phase into
implementation, benchmarking opcodes, drafting a proposal for community review,
and building extensive test coverage. A testnet-ready implementation will
follow, including activation methods and extended testing on environments like
Inquisition or dedicated sidechains. The ultimate goal is to make Bitcoin Script
more expressive while maintaining robust network protections.

### 256 Foundation

The 256 Foundation is creating a fully open-source Bitcoin mining stack to
replace proprietary mining solutions. Through four core projects—[Ember
One](https://github.com/256-Foundation/emberone00-pcb?tab=readme-ov-file#emberone00),
[Mujina Mining
Firmware](https://github.com/256-Foundation/Mujina-Mining-Firmware-website?tab=readme-ov-file#open-mining-firmware),
[Libre Board](https://github.com/256-Foundation/Libre-Board), and [Hydra
Pool](https://github.com/256-Foundation/Hydra-Pool?tab=readme-ov-file#hydra-pool)—the
Foundation is developing everything from standardized hashboards to modular
control boards and open-source mining pools. These efforts aim to lower barriers
to entry, increase hardware flexibility, and give developers more control over
how mining infrastructure is built and operated.

With support from this grant, Ember One will expand support to Intel ASICs,
Mujina will evolve into a full-featured miner, Libre Board will complete its
control board design, and Hydra Pool will launch with initial support for solo
mining and payout mechanisms. Together, these projects will help shift Bitcoin
mining toward open standards, giving builders and miners new tools to operate
independently of proprietary systems.

Each of these projects contributes to a more decentralized,
censorship-resistant, and globally accessible Bitcoin ecosystem. Whether
advancing protocol capabilities, building critical infrastructure, or improving
user privacy and sovereignty, they represent the kind of work that strengthens
Bitcoin's long-term utility and integrity.

As with every funding [wave](/tags/wave), OpenSats evaluated proposals based on
clearly defined [criteria](/apply#criteria) that are aligned with [our
mission](https://opensats.org/mission). We remain committed to supporting
builders who uphold the principles of free and open-source software.

If you're developing something aligned with these goals, we encourage you to
[apply for funding](/apply).

To support the Bitcoin ecosystem through open-source projects like these, please
consider donating to the General Fund.
