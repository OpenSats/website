---

We're excited to announce the twelfth wave of grants from our General Fund,
supporting twelve open-source projects advancing the Bitcoin ecosystem. This
round features five first-time grants and seven grant renewals for ongoing
efforts that continue to deliver meaningful results.

New project grantees in this wave are building tools for deeper bitcoin
analytics, anonymous mining payouts, mobile ecash payments, and Lightning and
full-node development within the .NET and Swift ecosystems.

The five first-time project grants in this wave are:

- [Sovran](#sovran)
- [NLightning](#nlightning)
- [Swift Bitcoin](#swift-bitcoin)
- [Bitcoin Research Kit](#bitcoin-research-kit)
- [Hashpool and Axepool](#hashpool-and-axepool)

The seven project grant renewals in this wave are:

- [Krux](/blog/bitcoin-grants-july-2024#krux)
- [Vexl](/blog/bitcoin-grants-december-2023#vexl)
- [Utreexo](/blog/bitcoin-grants-july-2024#utreexo)
- [Nutshell](/blog/8th-wave-of-bitcoin-grants#cashu-nutshell)
- [DLC Dev Kit](/blog/bitcoin-grants-september-2024-7th-wave#dlc-dev-kit)
- [Bitcoin Core App](/blog/caring-for-bitcoin-core#bitcoin-core-app)
- [Validating Lightning
  Signer](/blog/bitcoin-grants-july-2024#validating-lightning-signer)

Together, these twelve projects highlight a shared goal: making Bitcoin more
decentralized, transparent, and user-driven—while keeping it robust, usable,
and open to anyone who chooses to participate.

None of this would be possible without the generosity of our donors. If you'd
like to help move Bitcoin forward by supporting projects like those in this
wave, consider donating to our General Fund.

Let's explore our first-time project grants to understand what they're building
and how it strengthens the broader Bitcoin landscape.

### Sovran

[Sovran](https://sovran.money) is a free and open-source ecash and Lightning 
wallet built for iOS. It is designed to improve usability across
[Cashu](https://cashu.space/)-based payments. The app supports multiple mints,
NFC-based transactions, and integrates native connectivity tools like eSIM and
VPN. Sovran has reached a stable release and ships with core Cashu
functionality.

Support from this grant will fund multipath payment support, new tools for
managing balances across mints, and a specification for unified payment
addresses. The team will improve NFC performance and begin development of an
Android version. These upgrades will make Sovran more flexible, more accessible,
and better suited for everyday ecash use.

### NLightning

[NLightning](https://nlightning.ipms.io/) is an open-source Lightning Network
node written in C# for the [.NET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.NET) ecosystem,
implementing core BOLT specifications including
[BOLT](https://github.com/lightning/bolts) 1-3 and 8-11. The project focuses on
delivering a modular, efficient, and production-grade solution tailored for
enterprise and open-source developers already working within the .NET stack.
NLightning has published [NuGet packages](https://www.nuget.org/packages),
supports [invoice generation through
BOLT11](https://www.nuget.org/packages/NLightning.Bolt11/0.2.0), and maintains
over 70% test coverage.

Support from this grant will fund further implementation of BOLT 4, BOLT 5, and
BOLT 7. The project aims to complete a full Lightning daemon with channel
operations, [HTLC](https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/htlc/) handling, and payment
routing. Additional work will improve data structures, backup systems, developer
tooling, and documentation. One of the upcoming goals of the project is to
expand test coverage and fuzz testing to make the implementation more robust and
production-ready.

### Swift Bitcoin

[Swift Bitcoin](https://swiftbitcoin.org/) is an open-source software
development kit (SDK) and network client written entirely in
[Swift](https://www.swift.org/documentation/). It offers a full node
implementation with [PSBT](https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/psbt/) support,
[miniscript](https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/miniscript/) domain-specific
language, and [non-blocking I/O](https://github.com/apple/swift-nio#). The
project has evolved over three years and already syncs and validates blocks,
processes transactions, and matches Bitcoin Core on regtest. It delivers modular
libraries for crypto, base protocol, wallet, blockchain, transport, and RPC use.

Support from this grant will fund
[testnet4](https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/testnet/) syncing and completion of
the wire protocol. Development will focus on peer-to-peer messaging, protocol
alignment with Bitcoin Core, and expanded network testing. The project will also
refine core modules, increase cross-platform stability, and move closer to a
full-featured Swift-native node.

### Bitcoin Research Kit

Bitcoin Research Kit (BRK) is a toolchain that parses, indexes, computes, and
visualizes data from a Bitcoin Core node. It aims to combine the functions of
[Glassnode](https://glassnode.com/), [mempool.space](https://mempool.space/),
and [electrs](https://github.com/romanz/electrs#) in one self-hostable package.
The project focuses on performance, low resource requirements, and ease of use.
Users can run it from a command line interface or the public site
[Kibo.Money](https://kibo.money/). The system includes modular Rust crates, open
APIs, and time-based charts. It supports a wide range of use cases for
researchers, miners, node operators, and analysts.

This grant will support the development of a full-featured explorer. Planned
features include block, address, and transaction explorers, and support for both
mempool.space and Electrum protocols. The explorer will include original data
visualizations such as price distribution by block. The team will also improve
the user experience for self-hosting with pre-built binaries, optional
Cloudflare tunnels, and integrated
[`bitcoind`](https://crates.io/crates/corepc-node) support. A `terminal` view
for complex queries, a toggle to disable price data, and server monitoring with
Prometheus are also planned. The project will launch a dedicated website for
[bitcoinresearchkit.org](http://bitcoinresearchkit.org) and create independent
branding for BRK and Kibo.

### Hashpool and Axepool

[Hashpool](https://hashpool.dev/) is an accountless mining pool that issues
eHash ecash tokens for each accepted mining share. It runs a modified Stratum V2
pool, mints blinded tokens, and enables anonymous mining and trading of shares.
[Axepool](https://hashpool.dev/dev-logs/dev-log-2025-04-05/#axepool) is a proxy
layer for small-scale miners, such as [Bitaxes](https://bitaxe.org/). It uses 
the Cashu protocol to simplify setup, eliminate accounts, and support frequent 
ecash payouts.

With support from this grant, the project will complete
[NUT-04](https://github.com/cashubtc/nuts/blob/main/04.md) compliant ecash
issuance. It will launch a mint daemon, set up [Redis](https://redis.io/about/)
for share tracking, and apply a
[PPLNS](https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/pooled-mining/#pay-per-last-n-shares-pplns)
valuation model. It will add scheduled keyset rotation and create full developer
documentation, CI builds, and test coverage. Axepool will add SV1 multiplexing,
Bolt 12 callbacks, Bitaxe wallet integration, and releases for home node
platforms. A stretch goal will add a Proof of Liabilities protocol with share
validation.

From data-rich research dashboards and anonymous mining payouts to mobile ecash
wallets and cross-platform developer tooling, the projects in this twelfth wave
help reinforce the foundations that keep Bitcoin decentralized, robust, and open
to all. By supporting both new efforts and ongoing work, we aim to expand
access, improve usability, and strengthen privacy throughout the ecosystem.

As with earlier [waves](/tags/wave), grant applications were reviewed against
clear [criteria](/apply#criteria) aligned with [our mission](/mission) of
supporting free and open-source software. If you're working on a project that
advances Bitcoin, we encourage you to [apply for funding](/apply).

In total, OpenSats has now issued [over 300 grants](/transparency) since the
[start of our grant program][start], underscoring the scale and reach of our
commitment to open-source builders.

Our work is made possible by the generosity of our donors. If you'd like to
help make the future of free and open-source Bitcoin development more
sustainable, consider setting up a recurring donation to one of our funds. Any
amount helps.
