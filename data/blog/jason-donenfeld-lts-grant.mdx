OpenSats is proud to provide long-term support for [Jason
Donenfeld](https://github.com/zx2c4), a pivotal figure in developing essential
cryptographic and networking tools.

Jason is the creator of [WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.com/), a highly secure
VPN protocol, along with several [other projects](https://www.zx2c4.com/), and
the primary author and maintainer of the [Linux kernel's random number generator
(RNG)](https://git.zx2c4.com/linux-rng/about/), both of which play a critical
role in the Bitcoin ecosystem.

WireGuard is instrumental in securing communications between nodes and data
centers, safeguarding Bitcoin's network integrity. The Linux kernel RNG, which
Jason has significantly improved, is vital for generating the cryptographic keys
that Bitcoin relies on, making his work indispensable to the security of Bitcoin
and its related technologies.

With the support of this grant, Jason will focus on the following:

- Continued development and maintenance of WireGuard across various platforms.
- Enhancing the Linux kernel RNG to ensure cryptographic robustness.
- Advancing other cryptography-related components within the Linux kernel.
- Potential updates to related tools like [cgit](https://github.com/zx2c4/cgit)
  and [pass](https://www.passwordstore.org/).

OpenSats is committed to supporting developers who strengthen the open-source
foundations of Bitcoin and related technologies.
