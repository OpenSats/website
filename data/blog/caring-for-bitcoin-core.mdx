In keeping with our commitment to supporting the Bitcoin ecosystem, OpenSats is
pleased to announce a new round of grants focused on Bitcoin Core development.
In addition to supporting multiple core developers for the long term, we are
excited to provide grants for three up-and-coming developers working on
Bitcoin's reference implementation.

Listed in no particular order, they are:

- [@tdb3](#tdb3)
- [@davidgumberg (David Gumberg)](#davidgumberg-david-gumberg)
- [@hodlinator](#hodlinator)

In addition to the above, we are supporting the development of the [Bitcoin Core
App](#bitcoin-core-app), a modernized user interface for Bitcoin Core, and the
[Bitcoin Core Testing
Suite](/blog/bitcoin-grants-feb-2024#bitcoin-core-testing-suite), as announced
earlier this year.

We are dedicated to nurturing both established and emerging talent in the
Bitcoin developer community, ensuring that Bitcoin Core remains a strong and
resilient foundation for the entire network.

These grants are sourced from our [General Fund](/funds/general), which is
supported by generous donors like you. If you would like to support free and
open-source projects that help Bitcoin flourish, consider donating to the fund:

Now let's explore their contributions in more detail to understand their purpose
and how the grants will support their efforts.

### @tdb3

[tdb3](https://github.com/tdb3) focuses on improving stability, security, and
performance by actively engaging in the review and authoring of [pull requests
for Bitcoin Core](http://bitcoinacks.com/). With over 300 open PRs at the time
of this writing, there is a significant need for quality technical contributions
and reviews to maintain this essential software.

His initial efforts will concentrate on maintenance, bug-fixing, and feature
enhancement. Efforts will then focus on key areas for improvement, such as
making the interface easier for other developers to understand and use. Best
practices from mission-critical software development will be incorporated to
further stabilize and secure the network. These activities aim to help
developers ensure the continued reliability and resilience of Bitcoin Core,
contributing to the overall robustness of the Bitcoin network.

### @davidgumberg (David Gumberg)

[David](https://github.com/davidgumberg) focuses on optimizing the [Initial
Block Download
(IBD)](https://developer.bitcoin.org/devguide/p2p_network.html#initial-block-download)
process for Bitcoin Core nodes. IBD involves downloading and verifying the
entire Bitcoin blockchain, a process that can be resource-intensive in terms of
time, bandwidth, and storage. The project aims to reduce these challenges,
making it easier for users with limited resources to run full nodes. Primary
initiatives include developing infrastructure to benchmark IBD performance
across different hardware and network setups, monitoring for performance
regressions in Bitcoin Core's development branches, and evaluating proposals
that aim to enhance IBD efficiency.

This grant will fund efforts to thoroughly analyze and improve the IBD process.
Initial efforts will involve understanding the current IBD mechanisms and
assessing existing proposals that aim to optimize efficiency, such as those that
minimize data downloads or streamline index-building. The project will also
create a benchmarking tool to evaluate IBD under various conditions. Later
stages will focus on identifying new opportunities for performance enhancements
using profiling tools and considering theoretical improvements. The overarching
goal is to lower the barriers to running a full Bitcoin Core node, thereby
promoting greater decentralization and resilience within the Bitcoin network.

### @hodlinator

[Hodlinator](https://github.com/hodlinator) is focused on enhancing the [Bitcoin
Core](https://bitcoincore.org/) codebase through detailed code reviews and
addressing minor yet impactful concerns. Key activities include investigating
performance inefficiencies, improving logging and debugging practices,
developing tools to identify regressions, and refining the behavior of
functional tests. Using their strong background in
[C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B) development, Hodlinator aims to
bring a meticulous and thorough approach to Bitcoin Core.

This grant will support efforts in reviewing pull requests from other
contributors, diagnosing and addressing the slowness of some extended functional tests,
enhancing build information logs for better troubleshooting, and creating a tool
to identify regressions by analyzing the impact of different commits on test
outcomes. Additionally, the project will modify test timeout behaviors to
provide more detailed feedback on tests that approach timeout thresholds. These
activities aim to enhance the robustness and reliability of Bitcoin Core by
improving the efficiency and accuracy of the review process and addressing
critical elements within the codebase.

### Bitcoin Core App

The [Bitcoin Core App](https://bitcoincore.app/) is an attempt to modernize
Bitcoin Core's user interface by transitioning from the slightly outdated [Qt
Widgets](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtwidgets-index.html) framework to the more
modern [Qt-QML](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtqml-index.html) framework. The redesign
will incorporate user experience enhancements developed in collaboration with
leaders from the [Bitcoin Design Community](https://bitcoin.design/).

The project aims to lower technical barriers, promote self-custody, enhance
privacy, and strengthen the Bitcoin network by increasing participation in node
operation. A significant feature under development is to provide compatibility
with mobile devices, particularly targeting Android platforms. The aim is to
make running a full Bitcoin node more accessible and convenient, allowing users
to participate in the Bitcoin network directly from their mobile phones.

OpenSats remains committed to fostering a vibrant and resilient Bitcoin
ecosystem. The above grants supplement our long-term support program for Bitcoin
Core developers, which currently supports [Marco
Falke](/blog/announcing-lts-grant-program-to-support-bitcoin-core-contributors),
[Josi Baker](/blog/josi-baker-receives-opensats-lts-grant), [Sjors
Provoost](/blog/sjors-provoost-receives-opensats-lts-grant), [Vasil
Dimov](/blog/vasil-dimov-receives-lts-grant), [Will
