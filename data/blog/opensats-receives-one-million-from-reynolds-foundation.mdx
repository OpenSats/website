People often say that Bitcoin is a marathon, not a sprint. We believe that this
is accurate, which is why our focus is on providing sustainable funding and
[long-term support](/tags/lts).

In order to fund freedom tech for the [next
decade](/blog/bitcoin-infrastructure-this-decade) and longer, we need to build
long-term partnerships with individuals and organizations that are aligned with
[our mission](/mission).  One such organization is the [Reynolds
Foundation](https://reynoldsfoundation.com/), which is doing its part today, to
make a difference tomorrow.

We are delighted to announce that the Reynolds Foundation is supporting OpenSats
with a very generous donation of $1,000,000.

100% of said donation will be used to support open-source projects and
contributors working on freedom tech. Our [operational budget](/funds/ops) is
funded separately, which allows us to not take any cut from donations going to
our open-source funds.

We are doing what we can to do our part today, so that we may make a difference
when it comes to providing the freedom tools of tomorrow. And we couldn't do it
without the help of our generous donors.

Thank you, Reynolds Foundation, for putting your trust and confidence in
OpenSats. We'll do our best to make it count.

If you are an open-source contributor working on freedom tech that is aligned
with our mission, don't hesitate to apply for a grant via
[opensats.org/apply](/apply).
