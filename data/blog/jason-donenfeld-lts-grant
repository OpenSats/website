OpenSats is proud to provide long-term support for Jason Donenfeld, a pivotal
figure in developing essential cryptographic and networking tools.

Jason is the creator of[WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.com/), a highly secure
VPN protocol, along with several[other projects](https://www.zx2c4.com/), and a
key contributor to the[Linux kernel's random number generator
(RNG)](https://git.zx2c4.com/linux-rng/about/), both of which play a critical
role in the Bitcoin ecosystem.

WireGuard is instrumental in securing communications between nodes and data
centers; safeguarding Bitcoin's network integrity. The Linux kernel RNG, which
Jason has significantly improved, is vital for generating the cryptographic keys
that Bitcoin relies on, making his work indispensable to the security of Bitcoin
and its related technologies.

With the support of this grant, Jason will focus on the following:

- Continued development and maintenance of WireGuard across various platforms.
- Enhancing the Linux kernel RNG to ensure cryptographic robustness.
- Advancing other cryptography-related components within the Linux kernel.
- Potential updates to related tools like[cgit](https://github.com/zx2c4/cgit)
  and [pass](https://www.passwordstore.org/).

> My overarching objective is to continue advancing the core infrastructure that
> underpins Bitcoin and broader security technologies. It is important to keep
> these critical systems secure and continuously evolving.
