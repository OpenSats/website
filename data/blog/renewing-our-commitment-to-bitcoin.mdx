---

Over the past two years, we have made [41 announcements](/tags/bitcoin) from our
General Fund highlighting our commitment to support individual contributors and
projects working to not only grow the Bitcoin ecosystem but also make it more
resilient and robust in the process. Without the tireless effort of these
open-source contributors, as well as their innovation, dedication,
collaboration, and commitment to financial freedom, bitcoin wouldn't be where it
is today.

Bitcoin's influence is ever expanding—not just for individuals reclaiming their
financial independence and redefining what it means to send value without
middlemen, but also affecting public markets, creating new financial
instruments, and other innovations that bridge traditional finance with what has
become the world's most pristine asset. All this demonstrates that Bitcoin is
working as intended: it is slowly but surely reshaping how money operates. Every
10 minutes.

In addition to the grants we have announced in the past, we are renewing our
commitment to 9 exceptional projects advancing the ecosystem on various fronts:

- [BTCPay Server](/blog/bitcoin-grants-july-2023#btcpay-server)
- [Stratum V2](/blog/bitcoin-and-nostr-grants-august-2023#stratum-v2-testing--benchmarking-tool)
- [Raspiblitz](/blog/bitcoin-grants-july-2023#raspiblitz)
- [LNbits](/blog/bitcoin-and-nostr-grants-august-2023#lnbits)
- [Vexl](/blog/bitcoin-grants-december-2023#vexl)
- [Blixt](/blog/bitcoin-grants-july-2023#blixt-wallet)
- [Krux](/blog/bitcoin-grants-december-2023#krux)
- [Bitaxe](/blog/bitcoin-grants-feb-2024#the-bitaxe)
- [Labelbase](/blog/bitcoin-grants-july-2023#labelbase)

These projects remind us of [our purpose](/mission): to ensure that open-source
builders and innovators in the Bitcoin space have the resources they need to
push boundaries. In addition to these projects, our commitment and long-term
support to [key infrastructure engineers](/tags/core) remains unchanged.

As Bitcoin continues to redefine the future of money, the work of these
individuals and projects is crucial for making Bitcoin the best and strongest
system it can be. Their dedication to free and open-source development ensures
that the freedom tools we use remain secure, decentralized, and accessible to
anyone.

We're grateful to our donors, whose generosity makes this support possible. Your
contributions directly empower the builders shaping Bitcoin's path forward. If
you share our vision, then please consider donating to the [General
Fund](/funds/general):
