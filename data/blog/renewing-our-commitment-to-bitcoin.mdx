Over the past two years, we have made [41 announcements](/tags/bitcoin) from our
General Fund highlighting our commitment to supporting individual contributors
and projects working to grow the Bitcoin ecosystem. This ecosystem is built on
the innovation, dedication, collaboration, and the tireless efforts of
open-source contributors.

Bitcoin's influence is ever expanding---not just for individuals reclaiming
financial independence, but also affecting public markets, creating new
financial instruments, and [other
innovations](https://www.accesswire.com/946068/newmarket-launches-battery-finance-a-pioneering-asset-management-and-specialty-finance-platform-built-on-bitcoin-completes-inaugural-credit-investment)
that bridge traditional finance with this pristine digital asset class. All this
demonstrates that the Bitcoin experiment is working; as intended, it is slowly
but surely reshaping how money operates.

Beyond our previous announcements, our commitment runs deeper. We've doubled
down our support for 9 exceptional projects advancing the Bitcoin ecosystem.
These projects remind us of [our purpose](/mission): to ensure that open-source
builders and innovators in the Bitcoin space have the resources they need to
push boundaries. It's an honor to provide additional grants to the following
projects:

- [BTCPay Server](/blog/bitcoin-grants-july-2023#btcpay-server)
- [Stratum
  V2](/blog/bitcoin-and-nostr-grants-august-2023#stratum-v2-testing--benchmarking-tool)
- [RaspiBlitz](/blog/bitcoin-grants-july-2023#raspiblitz)
- [LNbits](/blog/bitcoin-and-nostr-grants-august-2023#lnbits)

- [Bitaxe](/blog/bitcoin-grants-feb-2024#the-bitaxe)
- [Labelbase](/blog/bitcoin-grants-july-2023#labelbase)

In addition to these projects, our commitment and long-term support to [key
infrastructure engineers](/tags/core) remains unchanged.

As Bitcoin continues to redefine the future of money, the work of these
individuals and projects are the foundation for its progress. Their dedication
to free and open-source development ensures that Bitcoin remains secure,
decentralized, and accessible to everyone.

We're grateful to our donors, whose generosity makes this support possible. Your
contributions directly empower the builders shaping Bitcoin's path forward. If
you share our vision, then please consider making a donation to the [General
