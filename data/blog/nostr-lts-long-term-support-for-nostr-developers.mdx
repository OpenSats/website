One of the things we are most proud of is the success of our [long-term support
program](/tags/lts).  Launched just last year, the OpenSats LTS Grant program is
supporting a dozen developers working on open-source freedom tech full-time.

As nostr is moving from [experimental to substantial](/tags/nostr)—and if our
hunch is right, from substantial to essential, eventually—we think it's time to
include nostr devs in the group that is [load-bearing internet
people](/blog/announcing-lts-grant-program-to-support-bitcoin-core-contributors).

The idea is simple: we want you to work on the freedom tech you're passionate
about, without having to stress out about how to pay for food or rent every
month. You did great work in the past, so we trust that you will do great work
in the future. You are free to work on any project, library, or protocol as you
see fit, as long as it is bitcoin-only, free and open-source, and aligns with
[our mission](/mission).

All of our nostr grants, including our long-term support grants for nostr
developers, are sourced from [The Nostr Fund](/projects/nostr) and made possible
by generous donors like you.

If you're working on free and open-source nostr infrastructure and/or the
protocol itself, and/or are working on something that is struck by the tragedy
of the commons, don't hesitate to [apply for an LTS Grant](/apply/lts).
