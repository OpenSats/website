OpenSats is proud to announce that [Vitor
Pamplona](https://github.com/vitorpamplona) has been granted long-term support
for his exceptional contributions to the nostr ecosystem.

Vitor is the creator of Amethyst, a widely-used and configurable nostr client
for Android users, and one of the architects behind the [new hyper-private DM
protocol](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/17.md) for nostr.

Among its [extensive features](https://github.com/vitorpamplona/amethyst),
Amethyst supports multiple user accounts, live streams, marketplaces, group
chats, custom feeds via [data vending
machines](https://www.data-vending-machines.org/), and integrates "zaps" to
enable users to exchange value directly within the app. Privacy and security are
further enhanced by allowing traffic routing through the Tor network via
[Orbot](https://orbot.app/en/).

In addition to Amethyst, Vitor has developed
[Sheetstr](https://sheetstr.amethyst.social/), a collaborative spreadsheet
client for nostr, and [Crafters](https://github.com/vitorpamplona/crafters), a
nostr-based resume builder.

With support from this grant, Vitor plans to focus on several key enhancements,
such as:

- Improving topical discussions, value-for-value exchanges, user collaboration
  through new credentialing schemes, and deeper integration with nostr Android
  apps.

- Restructuring
  [Quartz](https://github.com/vitorpamplona/amethyst/tree/main/quartz) and
  [Ammolite](https://github.com/vitorpamplona/amethyst/tree/main/ammolite) for
  cross-platform support, simplifying code, enhancing documentation, integrating
  Amethyst's caching, and supporting [Kotlin
  Notebooks](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/kotlin-notebook-overview.html) for
  dynamic story development.

- Publishing new NIPs and [testbed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testbed) apps
  to simplify nostr development, enabling other nostr projects, teams, and
  developers to leverage and realize new use cases.

- Finalizing and implementing the outbox model to enable private, direct
  messaging, minimizing broadcast exposure.
