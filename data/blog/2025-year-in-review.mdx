Twenty-twenty-five. The momentum continues. Over the past year, we have given
more grants, published our first impact reports, and onboarded more long-term support
grantees than ever before. We want to take the opportunity to pause, reflect,
and share our year in review—looking back at announcements, donations, fund
allocation, and grantee growth—before providing an outlook for the year ahead.

- [Allocation](#allocation)
- [Grantees](#grantees)
- [Outlook](#outlook)

Before we dive into the numbers, a brief reminder of why we do what we do.
OpenSats exists to provide [consistent funding](/about) for free and open-source
projects, especially those that help bitcoin flourish. We believe these projects
have the potential to revolutionize individual sovereignty and
liberty—values that underpin everything we support. Our structure keeps overhead
low: we don't take a cut from donations, and our 9-person board ensures no
single individual controls funding decisions.

We continue to learn and improve. Some grants will produce outsized returns;
others won't pan out as hoped. We accept this reality and strive to get better
at [selecting projects](/selection) with each passing year. The growth detailed
in this report reflects the dedication of our grantees, the generosity of our
donors, and the tireless efforts of our volunteers and team.

## Announcements

We began 2025 by announcing [additional grants for Bitcoin Core
contributors](/blog/more-for-core), awarding support to
[L0rinc](/blog/more-for-core#l0rinc),
[kevkevinpal](/blog/more-for-core#kevkevinpal), and
[Daniela Brozzoni](/blog/more-for-core#danielabrozzoni)—all focused on
performance, testing, and code review for Bitcoin's reference implementation.

In June, we welcomed [SnowCait](/blog/snowcait-receives-lts-grant) to our
long-term support roster for his work on the nostr ecosystem, including the
`nostter` client and `Snowflare` relay. In December, we announced LTS grants for
[Andrew Toth](/blog/andrew-toth-receives-lts-grant), a Bitcoin Core contributor
working on IBD performance and Silent Payments BIPs, and [Brad
Stachurski](/blog/brad-stachurski-receives-lts), a Fedimint co-maintainer
focused on security and deployment tooling.

Throughout 2025, we announced [seven waves of bitcoin
grants](/tags/wave)—from the [9th wave](/blog/ninth-wave-of-bitcoin-grants) in
January through the [15th wave](/blog/fifteenth-wave-of-bitcoin-grants) in
December. These waves supported projects ranging from [Silent Payments
tooling](/blog/fifteenth-wave-of-bitcoin-grants#blindbit-suite) and
[mining decentralization](/blog/eleventh-wave-of-bitcoin-grants#256-foundation)
to [protocol research](/blog/fifteenth-wave-of-bitcoin-grants#lnhance) and
[developer well-being](/blog/tenth-wave-of-bitcoin-grants#waye).

On the nostr side, we announced [five waves of
grants](/tags/nostr)—from the [10th
wave](/blog/10th-wave-of-nostr-grants) in March through the [14th
wave](/blog/fourteenth-wave-of-nostr-grants) in December. Projects funded
include [Frostr](/blog/twelfth-wave-of-nostr-grants#frostr) for threshold
signing, [HAMSTR](/blog/eleventh-wave-of-nostr-grants#hamstr) for nostr over ham
radio, [Gitplaza](/blog/twelfth-wave-of-nostr-grants#gitplaza) for decentralized
code collaboration, and
[Zapstore](/blog/10th-wave-of-nostr-grants#zapstore) for permissionless app
distribution.

In April, we announced our [4th wave of education
grants](/blog/fourth-wave-of-education-grants), supporting [Librería de
Satoshi](/blog/fourth-wave-of-education-grants#librería-de-satoshi) for Spanish
technical training, [Crack the
Orange](/blog/fourth-wave-of-education-grants#crack-the-orange) for the Global
South, and [FREE Madeira](/blog/fourth-wave-of-education-grants#free-madeira)
for Bitcoin education in Portugal.

One of our most significant announcements came in March with "[Let a Thousand
Flowers Bloom](/blog/let-a-thousand-flowers-bloom)," where we funded six
organizations working to expand the open-source funding ecosystem:
[2140](/blog/let-a-thousand-flowers-bloom#2140) (European nonprofit for Bitcoin
Core), [OpenCash](/blog/let-a-thousand-flowers-bloom#opencash) (Swiss nonprofit
for Cashu), [Bitshala](/blog/let-a-thousand-flowers-bloom#bitshala) (India
developer education), [Summer of
Bitcoin](/blog/let-a-thousand-flowers-bloom#summer-of-bitcoin) (global
internship program), [Bitcoin Dev
Launchpad](/blog/let-a-thousand-flowers-bloom#bitcoin-dev-launchpad) (Vinteum's
40-week training), and the [Foundation Formation
Kit](/blog/let-a-thousand-flowers-bloom#foundation-formation-kit) (tools for
creating tax-exempt foundations). We believe a healthy ecosystem requires many
funding sources, and these organizations help make that possible.

Our support for all of these projects and initiatives is made possible by our
donors. If you like what we do, please consider [making a
donation](/donate).

## Donations

In 2025 we received significant support from both individual donors and
organizations committed to funding open-source development.

The [Human Rights Foundation](/blog/additional-ops-budget-from-hrf) contributed
\$250,000 to our Operations Budget, allowing us to maintain the organizational
infrastructure that makes our grant-giving possible. The [Reynolds
Foundation](/blog/opensats-receives-two-million-donation-from-the-reynolds-foundation)
followed up their 2024 gift with an additional \$2,000,000 donation to our
General Fund.

In October, [Tether](/blog/opensats-receives-dollar250k-donation-from-tether)
donated \$250,000, and [StarkWare together with the Starknet
Foundation](/blog/opensats-receives-dollar400k-donation-from-starkware-starknet)
contributed \$400,000—both directed to our General Fund. These donations
reflect a growing recognition that Bitcoin's open-source foundation requires
sustained investment.

We also received our first bitcoin-denominated recurring commitment when [Steak
'n Shake](/blog/opensats-receives-donation-commitment-from-steak-n-shake)
announced they would donate 210 sats from every Bitcoin Meal sold over the
next twelve months. This model—where companies direct a portion of
bitcoin-related revenue to open-source funding—represents a pattern we hope
others will follow.

In terms of individual donations, bitcoin payment rails continue to dominate.
The ratio of Lightning to on-chain payments remained steady at approximately
70% Lightning. The vast majority of donations continue to flow to our [General
Fund](/funds/general), with the remainder split between [The Nostr
Fund](/funds/nostr) and our [Operations Budget](/funds/ops).

![](/static/images/blog/2024-eoy/donations.png)

We remain committed to our model: 100% of donations to our General Fund and The
Nostr Fund go directly to grantees. Our operations are funded separately,
allowing donors to support projects with confidence that their contributions
reach developers directly.

## Impact Reports

In 2025, we published our first comprehensive impact reports, highlighting the
work of our grantees across seven key areas:

- [On-chain privacy](/blog/developing-advancements-in-onchain-privacy)
- [Lightning infrastructure](/blog/advancements-in-lightning-infrastructure)
- [Developer training](/blog/advancements-in-developer-training)
- [Developer libraries](/blog/advancements-in-developer-libraries)
- [Ecash](/blog/advancements-in-ecash)
- [Bitcoin and Lightning wallets](/blog/advancements-in-bitcoin-and-lightning-wallets)
- [Nostr clients](/blog/advancements-in-nostr-clients)

These reports demonstrate the tangible progress our grants enable—from Payjoin
V2 going live in Bull Bitcoin and Cake Wallet, to the maturation of Cashu mobile
bindings, to major client improvements across Amethyst, Damus, and Coracle.

---

## Allocation

Our two funds serve distinct purposes: the [General Fund](/funds/general)
supports bitcoin-related projects and other free and open-source work that
helps bitcoin flourish, while [The Nostr Fund](/funds/nostr) focuses
specifically on the nostr ecosystem.

As of December 2025, we have allocated over \$18M in grants from the General
Fund and over \$11M from The Nostr Fund across the lifetime of both programs.
Year-over-year, this represents continued growth in our grant-giving capacity
and reach.

![](/static/images/blog/2024-eoy/allocation.png)

The convergence between bitcoin and nostr that we noted [last
year](/blog/2024-year-in-review#allocation) has accelerated. Ecash projects
like Cashu now use nostr for coordination and discovery. Wallets integrate
nostr for social payments and contact management. Mining pools experiment with
ecash tokens for anonymous payout mechanisms. These categories blur in practice,
though we maintain separate funds to ensure both ecosystems receive dedicated
support.

### Bitcoin: General Fund

In 2025, our General Fund grants emphasized several key areas: Bitcoin Core
development, Silent Payments infrastructure, Lightning improvements, ecash
tooling, mining decentralization, and developer libraries.

![](/static/images/blog/2024-eoy/bitcoin-distribution.png)

Bitcoin Core support remained central to our allocation. Beyond the LTS grants
for experienced contributors, we funded projects that strengthen the reference
implementation: performance optimizations, testing infrastructure, and the
[Great Script Restoration](/blog/eleventh-wave-of-bitcoin-grants#great-script-restoration)
research effort exploring disabled opcodes.

Silent Payments emerged as a major theme. We supported [Dana
Wallet](/blog/fifteenth-wave-of-bitcoin-grants#dana-wallet), [BlindBit
Suite](/blog/fifteenth-wave-of-bitcoin-grants#blindbit-suite), and the [Silent
Payments Shepherd](/blog/thirteenth-wave-of-bitcoin-grants#silent-payments-shepherd)
coordination project—all working to make reusable addresses practical for
everyday use.

Mining decentralization received substantial attention through grants to the
[256 Foundation](/blog/eleventh-wave-of-bitcoin-grants#256-foundation) (open-source
mining stack), [BitShoka](/blog/eleventh-wave-of-bitcoin-grants#bitshoka) (ASIC
reverse engineering for BitAxe), and
[Hashpool/Axepool](/blog/twelfth-wave-of-bitcoin-grants#hashpool-and-axepool)
(accountless mining pools using ecash). These projects work toward a future
where mining infrastructure is more accessible and less dependent on
proprietary systems.

On the ecash front, we continued supporting the Cashu ecosystem through grants
for [Nutshell](/blog/advancements-in-ecash#nutshell),
[Minibits](/blog/advancements-in-ecash#minibits-wallet),
[Nutstash](/blog/advancements-in-ecash#nutstash), and
[npub.cash](/blog/advancements-in-ecash#npubcash). The [OpenCash
Association](/blog/let-a-thousand-flowers-bloom#opencash) received support to
coordinate development and fund bounties across the ecosystem.

Developer libraries and tooling continued to mature. Our [impact report on
developer libraries](/blog/advancements-in-developer-libraries) detailed
progress across BDK, rust-bitcoin, secp256k1, DLC Dev Kit, Payjoin Dev Kit, and
lnprototest—all foundational projects that other developers build upon.

We also maintained our commitment to privacy infrastructure, including ongoing
support for projects like [KMP-Tor](/blog/thirteenth-wave-of-bitcoin-grants#kmp-tor)
and operating system diversity through
[FreeBSD](/blog/fifteenth-wave-of-bitcoin-grants#freebsd).

You can read more about these projects in our grant announcements from
[January](/blog/more-for-core),
[January](/blog/ninth-wave-of-bitcoin-grants),
[March](/blog/tenth-wave-of-bitcoin-grants),
[May](/blog/eleventh-wave-of-bitcoin-grants),
[July](/blog/twelfth-wave-of-bitcoin-grants),
[August](/blog/thirteenth-wave-of-bitcoin-grants),
[October](/blog/fourteenth-wave-of-bitcoin-grants), and
[December](/blog/fifteenth-wave-of-bitcoin-grants).

### Nostr: The Nostr Fund

The Nostr Fund continued to support projects across the protocol's expanding
scope. Client development remained important, but 2025 saw significant growth
in infrastructure, tooling, and novel use cases.

![](/static/images/blog/2024-eoy/nostr-distribution.png)

Our [nostr clients impact report](/blog/advancements-in-nostr-clients)
highlighted major advances: Amethyst's transition to the outbox model (enabling
connections to 1,000+ relays while preserving mobile performance), Coracle's
relay membership controls, Damus's Android launch and Notedeck development,
and Zap.stream's mobile live streaming apps.

Key management saw progress through
[Frostr](/blog/twelfth-wave-of-nostr-grants#frostr) (threshold signing using
FROST) and [Aegis](/blog/twelfth-wave-of-nostr-grants#aegis) (cross-platform
signer). These projects address the challenge of securing nostr identities
without sacrificing usability.

Decentralized collaboration advanced through
[Gitplaza](/blog/twelfth-wave-of-nostr-grants#gitplaza) and
[Grasp](/blog/thirteenth-wave-of-nostr-grants#grasp)—both working toward
nostr-native alternatives to centralized code hosting. The Nostr Double Ratchet
project brought Signal-style end-to-end encryption to nostr messaging.

Some of the most creative projects pushed nostr into unexpected territory:
[HAMSTR](/blog/eleventh-wave-of-nostr-grants#hamstr) enables nostr
communication over ham radio for off-grid and censorship-resistant
messaging. [Nostr Game Engine](/blog/eleventh-wave-of-nostr-grants#nostr-game-engine)
provides game developers with nostr-native infrastructure. [Atomic Signature
Swaps](/blog/twelfth-wave-of-nostr-grants#atomic-signature-swaps) enables
trustless exchange of Schnorr signatures between nostr, bitcoin, and Cashu.

Long-term support grantees—including
[fiatjaf](/blog/fiatjaf-receives-lts-grant),
[Vitor Pamplona](/blog/vitor-pamplona-receives-lts-grant),
[Hodlbod](/blog/hodlbod-receives-lts-grant),
[Kieran](/blog/kieran-receives-lts-grant), and
[hzrd149](/blog/hzrd149-receives-lts-grant)—continued their foundational work
on protocol development, client infrastructure, and ecosystem tooling. The
addition of [SnowCait](/blog/snowcait-receives-lts-grant) in June strengthened
our support for Japanese nostr development.

## Grantees

Throughout 2025, we maintained a pace of roughly a dozen new grants per month.
This steady growth reflects both continued donor support and a healthy pipeline
of applications from developers worldwide.

In total, we have now given over 350 grants since launching our grant program in
2023. The 2025 additions include approximately 140 new grants across bitcoin,
nostr, education, and ecosystem-building initiatives.

![](/static/images/blog/2024-eoy/grantees.png)

As of December 2025, we are sending approximately \$1.2M worth of bitcoin to
our grantees each month. Thanks to bitcoin and Lightning, we can do this with
minimal overhead and near-instant settlement—regardless of where our grantees
are located.

We continue to prioritize long-term relationships with grantees whose work
aligns with [our mission](/mission). Many of this year's grants were renewals
for projects that demonstrated continued progress and impact. As long as
funding permits and work remains aligned with our goals, we aim to provide the
stable support that allows developers to focus on building rather than
fundraising.

## Outlook

Bitcoin continues to mature as both technology and asset. Silent Payments
infrastructure is moving from specification to production. Ecash protocols are
gaining real users and merchant adoption. Mining decentralization efforts are
producing open hardware and accountless pool designs. The projects we support
are building the foundation for bitcoin's next decade.

Nostr has established itself as viable infrastructure for censorship-resistant
communication. The outbox model is proving that decentralized social networks
can work at scale. Clients are shipping features that rival centralized
platforms while preserving user control. The integration between nostr, bitcoin,
and ecash creates new possibilities for value transfer and identity that
didn't exist a year ago.

Looking ahead, we see several areas that will benefit from continued support:

**Protocol research and implementation.** Projects like LNHANCE are exploring
covenant constructions that could enable new types of channels and vaults.
Silent Payments tooling needs to reach maturity across major wallets. Ecash
protocols require ongoing standardization and security review.

**Infrastructure maintenance.** Developer libraries like BDK, rust-bitcoin, and
the various nostr SDKs underpin hundreds of applications. These projects need
sustained support for maintenance, security fixes, and compatibility updates.

**Developer onboarding.** Programs like Summer of Bitcoin, Bitcoin Dev
Launchpad, and Bitshala are training the next generation of contributors.
Education initiatives in underserved regions expand bitcoin's reach and
strengthen its resilience through geographic diversity.

**Ecosystem building.** The organizations we funded through "Let a Thousand
Flowers Bloom" are establishing funding infrastructure in new jurisdictions and
domains. We hope to see more nonprofits emerge to support open-source
development—the ecosystem benefits from multiple funding sources with different
focuses and perspectives.

Our goal remains the same: maintain a sustainable ecosystem of funding for free
and open-source projects. We rely on donations to fund our operations and the
projects we support. If you believe in what we're doing, please consider

We are grateful to everyone who contributed to OpenSats in 2025—whether through
donations, volunteer time, or simply spreading the word. Our grantees produced
meaningful work this year: code merged, protocols shipped, and users served.
This progress happens because people choose to support open-source development.

To our donors: thank you for making this possible. To our grantees: thank you
for the work you do. To everyone building, learning, and using freedom tech:
you are what makes this ecosystem worth supporting.

Here's to 2026. Onwards.
