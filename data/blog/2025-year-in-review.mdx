It's January 3rd as I'm writing these lines. Genesis day. Bitcoin's 17th
birthday. It's curious that Bitcoin's birthday lines up with the start of a new
year: a time to reflect, a time to look back at the year that has passed.

The little thing that Satoshi launched into the world is not so little anymore.
Not fully grown up, but also not a kid anymore. A teenager. More successful than
most teenagers, but still a teenager.

So: where are we in terms of Bitcoin's development? There's the obvious part and
the not-so-obvious part. Let's do the obvious first: Nation states hold BTC on
their balance sheets. Serious people with serious suites and serious companies
talk about it on TV, in a non-dismissive (serious) way. If you bring it up in
conversation you don't get laughed out of the room anymore. While most people
have heard of bitcoin by now, it is probably fair to say to that for the vast
majority contact was peripheral and understanding superficial. Consequently,
only a small percentage use it in a self-sovereign way. In absolute terms,
however, the number is growing. The mainstream association now seems to be
squarely in the "asset" and "digital gold" quadrant, as opposed to "speculation"
a couple of years ago, or gambling and shady internet money used exclusively for
questionable things before that.

Now to the not-so-obvious part: Bitcoin is still alive. It has operated since
seventeen years, mostly quietly, mostly in the background. A new block has been
mined every 10 minutes. Over 900,000 blocks since genesis, moving trillions of
sats in the process. The cumulative hash rate of the network is at an all-time
high: a number so unfathomably large that it's almost impossible to put into
comparison. Lightning liquidity is at an all-time high too, as is the number of
merchants accepting bitcoin as a form of payment. It's now easier than ever to
live on a bitcoin standard, thanks to countless open-source projects and the
services that build upon them. Bitcoin gets more efficient, resilient, and
useful by the day. From basic research to fuzz testing to Stratum V2 to Silent
Payments to Splicing to open-source tools for merchants and users, OpenSats is
funding a myriad of efforts across the stack to support Bitcoin through its
teenage years.

Over the last 18 months we've sent roughly \$1,000,000 USD worth of sats to
grantees in 40+ countries, every month. During the course of 2015 we supported
more than 150 active grantees at any point in time: small teams, large teams,
educational efforts, and—most importantly—individual developers.

When we reach out to our grantees we ask three simple questions: How did you
spend your time? What are your plans for next quarter? How did you use the
funds? We also follow it up with a fourth: Is there anything we could help with?

As we look back at 2025, it is now our turn to answer these questions.

## Announcements

> How did you spend your time?

Our mission is simple: we want to support and maintain a sustainable ecosystem
of funding for free and open-source projects and contributors, especially
bitcoin-related projects and projects that help bitcoin flourish. Our day-to-day
operations thus consist of the following: receiving grant applications,
evaluating grant applications (in terms of scope, technical feasibility,
clarity, potential impact, and scalability), doing due diligence, and arriving
at a final decision through majority vote. We want to support the best projects
and people. At the same time, we want to avoid wasting donor funds, which is why
we keep a close eye on our grantees to make sure that progress goals and agreed
upon milestones are hit. And last but not least, we are spending our time on
long-term donor relationships and fundraising efforts. After all, we can only
support as many grantees as we support if there's sats in our vaults.

We announce all our grants publicly on our blog, along with our initiatives and
noteworthy donations. Looking at the announcements made in 2025 one should get a
pretty good idea of what we've been up to: In January 2025 we've announced
[additional grants for bitcoin core contributors](/blog/more-for-core), followed
by a [wave of bitcoin grants](/blog/ninth-wave-of-bitcoin-grants) announced
shortly after. In February we published our first impact report: [Advancements
in On-Chain Privacy](/blog/developing-advancements-in-onchain-privacy). In March
we announced the [10th wave of grants](/blog/tenth-wave-of-bitcoin-grants) from
the General Fund as well as the [10th wave of grants](/blog/10th-wave-of-nostr-grants)
from The Nostr Fund. We also published "[Let a Thousand Flowers
Bloom](/blog/let-a-thousand-flowers-bloom)," outlining our thesis on how to best
scale OpenSats horizontally.

In April we announced our [4th wave of education
grants](/blog/fourth-wave-of-education-grants), followed by [another wave of
nostr grants](/blog/eleventh-wave-of-nostr-grants) and our next impact report:
[Advancements in Lightning Infrastructure](/blog/advancements-in-lightning-infrastructure).
In May we announced yet [another wave of grants](/blog/eleventh-wave-of-bitcoin-grants)
(and grant renewals) from our General Fund.

June marked the release of our third impact report, [Advancements in Developer
Training](/blog/advancements-in-developer-training), highlighting progress of
some of the developer-focused education initiatives we fund. Summer of Bitcoin,
Africa Free Routing, Bitcoin Dev Launchpad, and Bitshala. We also announced our
long-term support for [SnowCait](/blog/snowcait-receives-lts-grant), a prolific
nostr developer. In July we announced the [12th wave of
grants](/blog/twelfth-wave-of-bitcoin-grants) from the General Fund as well as
[the Nostr Fund](/blog/twelfth-wave-of-nostr-grants), respectively.

In August we published yet another impact report: [Advancements in Developer
Libraries](/blog/advancements-in-developer-libraries). We fund a lot of projects
that are by their very nature invisible to the end-user. Software development
kits and libraries that a myriad of projects depend upon. BDK, `rust-bitcoin`,
Payjoin Dev Kit, DLC Dev Kit, libraries focused on `secp256k1`, and many others.
Developing and maintaining these libraries is hard and often thankless, but
paramount to a flourishing bitcoin ecosystem. As one of our grantees Tobin
Harding succinctly put it: "My job is to provide libraries so other devs can
create software that users love. If no one ever mentions rust-bitcoin while
simultaneously using it every day, then we win." Our [13th wave of
grants](/blog/thirteenth-wave-of-bitcoin-grants), also announced in August,
showed our commitment to those infrastructure-like software projects: Tor,
DTails, and `ngx_L402` are all puzzle pieces to the larger freedom tech picture.

In September we highlighted what [advancements our grantees made on the ecash
front](/blog/advancements-in-ecash): Cashu, CDK, Nutshell, Minibits, Nutstash,
npub.cash, Hashpool, Fedimint, and OpenCash. We believe that Chaumian ecash has
a large role to play in bitcoin's future, and are proud to support the people
and projects who are pushing this technology forward.

In October we announced the [14th wave of grants](/blog/fourteenth-wave-of-bitcoin-grants)
from our General Fund, followed by an impact report on the [Advancements in
Bitcoin and Lightning Wallets](/blog/advancements-in-bitcoin-and-lightning-wallets).
In November we published the [13th wave of nostr
grants](/blog/thirteenth-wave-of-nostr-grants), and we concluded the year in
December with the announcement of the [14th](/blog/fourteenth-wave-of-nostr-grants)
and [15th wave](/blog/fifteenth-wave-of-bitcoin-grants) respectively, as well as
our first impact report focusing on the nostr ecosystem: [Advancements in Nostr
Clients](/blog/advancements-in-nostr-clients). On the last day of the year we
announced our long-term support for [Brad
Stachurski](/blog/brad-stachurski-receives-lts), who was the 2nd LTS recipient
in December, following [Andrew Toth](/blog/andrew-toth-receives-lts-grant).

## Allocation

> How did you use the funds?

OpenSats exists because we want to see contributors to Bitcoin and free and
open-source tools supported by a sustainable ecosystem and consistent funding.
Our LTS program (long-term support) aims to do just that: support the best
people for a multi-year period. Consequently, a lot of our funds are dedicated
to our LTS grantees. In 2025, we allocated a total of \$2,328,000 from our
General Fund to long-term support. We allocated twice as much to non-LTS grants,
with a total of \$5,639,789 allocated towards various project, as per our
announcements. In total, we have now given over 350 grants since launching our
grant program in 2023.

![](/static/images/blog/2025-eoy/2025-focus-areas.png)

In terms of allocation percentage, the ratio of LTS grants to regular grants is
the same as the previous year, with a clean 30/70 split. In terms of focus areas
the list is similar too, with an increased emphasis on developer libraries and
ecash.

As mentioned before, we are currently sending approximately \$1 million worth of
bitcoin to our grantees each month. Thanks to the power of magic internet money
we can do this with minimal overhead and near-instant settlement—regardless of
where our grantees are located. As of this writing, our grantees span over 40
countries:

On the nostr side our allocation is very similar to last year: around ~35% of
The Nostr Fund is allocated towards our LTS grantees:
[Pablo](/blog/pablofz7-receives-lts-grant),
[Stuart](/blog/stuart-bowman-receives-lts-grant),
[hzrd149](/blog/hzrd149-receives-lts-grant),
[Will](/blog/will-clark-receives-lts-grant),
[Yuki](/blog/yuki-receives-lts-grant),
[Hodlbod](/blog/hodlbod-receives-lts-grant),
[fiatjaf](/blog/fiatjaf-receives-lts-grant),

## Donations

> Is there anything we could help with?

We've been fortunate to receive large donations in the past, and 2025 was no
exception. The largest donation we received was a [\$2,000,000 gift from the
Reynolds Foundation](/blog/opensats-receives-two-million-donation-from-the-reynolds-foundation)
as announced in May, followed by a [\$400,000 donation from StarkWare and the
Starknet Foundation](/blog/opensats-receives-dollar400k-donation-from-starkware-starknet)
as announced in November. Further, we are grateful to have received a [multi-year
commitment from Steak 'n Shake](/blog/opensats-receives-donation-commitment-from-steak-n-shake)
and a [\$250,000 donation from Tether](/blog/opensats-receives-dollar250k-donation-from-tether),
as announced in October.

Since we don't take a cut from donations designated for open-source development,
we are incredibly grateful to have received [additional operational budget from
the Human Rights Foundation](/blog/additional-ops-budget-from-hrf), as announced
in February 2025 (and [again in January
2026](/blog/opensats-receives-funding-from-the-human-rights-foundation)). Our
operational budget is what allows us to keep the lights on, covering operations
and contractor expenses, legal and compliance fees, software and services, as
well as exchange and transaction fees. The financial statements on our
[transparency page](/transparency) go into more detail in regards to our
operational expenses.

In total we have received 674 donations totaling \$3,158,680. The majority of
these donations were made via the Lightning network, which is a trend that we
observed last year already, especially when it comes to smaller donations. Some
of our supporters use OpenSats as a target for zaps and streaming payments,
which is something we love to see. Refer to our [FAQ](/faq) if you're curious on
how to set this up.

As mentioned in our [mission statement](/mission), OpenSats is a 501(c)(3)
public charity that aims to support and maintain a *sustainable* ecosystem of
funding for free and open-source projects and contributors, especially
bitcoin-related projects and projects that help bitcoin flourish. Emphasis mine.
In other words: we want to continue to offer long-term support for load-bearing
internet people, providing at least some stability in an otherwise uncertain
world. Providing said stability depends on substantial and continual funding. We
can only continue to give grants if there's enough sats in our vaults, and we
can only give multi-year grants to exceptional people and projects if we receive
recurring donations.

The dream is to have OpenSats supported by the public, i.e. by millions of users
who benefit from the advancements that are made in the open-source ecosystem
that is the freedom tech movement. We are a long stretch away from that goal,
but we're confident that we'll be able to make substantial progress towards it
in the next couple of years.

Bitcoin is a multi-decade endeavor. As mentioned in the beginning, Bitcoin is
barely 17 years old. We are still at the very beginning of this transition. A
transition into a world that empowers the individual, allowing it to have more
sovereignty—financial or otherwise. The cypherpunks understood that free- and
open-source code is a powerful gateway to freedom, and we want to support those
who create and maintain said code. That is the mission of OpenSats: support and
maintain a sustainable ecosystem of funding for free and open-source projects
and contributors. Especially those that help bitcoin flourish.

We can only do it with your help, and we are grateful for every sat that comes
our way.

## Outlook

> What are your plans for next quarter?

That one is easy. We want to keep doing what we're doing, which is to send
billions of sats to hundreds of projects, month after month, year after year. We
want to continue to support the best and brightest. Those who are aligned with
our mission, who care about financial freedom and the future of the internet as
much as we do.

We will continue to publish impact reports, highlighting what our grantees have
been working on and how OpenSats funding is contributing to the progress that we
see across the freedom tech landscape. In addition to said impact reports we
want to work towards publishing a quarterly newsletter, highlighting some of the
projects we fund as well as the progress that is being made. If you're
interested in helping with this endeavor, please reach out to
`jobs@opensats.org`.

Last but not least, we want to get better at outreach and outward communication.
There is a large pool of developers that do not know about OpenSats and the
wider freedom tech movement. Further, there are many adjacent communities that
are working to solve similar problems but dismiss bitcoin (or nostr) for various
reasons. Some of these barriers are ideological, others are rooted in culture
and language. While we won't be able to convince everyone that bitcoin is worth
their time, we are convinced that outreach, communication, and the inevitable
cross-pollination of ideas that follows it, are worthwhile efforts.

Our focus is unchanged. We believe that free and open-source software is
essential to the future of the internet and the world. We want to fund software
that allows people to collaborate and share knowledge, without being locked into
proprietary solutions. We are committed to supporting the development of free
and open-source software, and we believe that bitcoin has the potential to
change the world. If you care about freedom tech and how it can help to not only
fix the money—but fix the world—consider [supporting us](/donate) in pursuing
our mission.

We are incredibly grateful for all the support we received in 2025, and we hope
that we can transfer this momentum into the following year. The progress our
grantees have made is astounding, and we are convinced that the compounding
effects of all the libraries, tools, SDKs, and general software that has been
shipped will pave the way for a future that has more freedom, fairness, liberty,
sovereignty, and stability.

Onward!
