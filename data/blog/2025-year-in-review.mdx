It's January 3rd as I'm writing these lines. Genesis day. Bitcoin's 17th
birthday. It's curious that Bitcoin's birthday lines up with the start of a new
year: a time to reflect, a time to look back at the year that has passed.

The little thing that Satoshi launched into the world is not so little anymore.
Not fully grown up, but also not a kid anymore. A teenager. More successful than
most teenagers, but still a teenager.

So: where are we in terms of Bitcoin's development? There's the obvious part and
the not-so-obvious part. Let's do the obvious first: Nation states hold BTC on
their balance sheets. Serious people with serious suites and serious companies
talk about it on TV, in a non-dismissive (serious) way. If you bring it up in
conversation you don't get laughed out of the room anymore. While most people
have heard of bitcoin by now, it is probably fair to say that for the vast
majority contact was peripheral and understanding superficial. Consequently,
only a small percentage use it in a self-sovereign way. In absolute terms,
however, the number is growing. The mainstream association now seems to be
squarely in the "asset" and "digital gold" quadrant, as opposed to "speculation"
a couple of years ago, or gambling and shady internet money used exclusively for
questionable things before that.

Now to the not-so-obvious part: Bitcoin is still alive. It has operated for
seventeen years, mostly quietly, mostly in the background. A new block has been
mined every 10 minutes. Over 900,000 blocks since genesis, moving trillions of
sats in the process. The cumulative hash rate of the network is at an all-time
high: a number so unfathomably large that it's almost impossible to put into
comparison. Lightning liquidity is at an all-time high too, as is the number of
merchants accepting bitcoin as a form of payment. It's now easier than ever to
live on a bitcoin standard, thanks to countless open-source projects and the
services that build upon them. Bitcoin gets more efficient, resilient, and
useful by the day. From basic research to fuzz testing to Stratum V2 to Silent
Payments to Splicing to open-source tools for merchants and users, OpenSats is
funding a myriad of efforts across the stack to support Bitcoin through its
teenage years.

Over the last 18 months we've sent roughly \$1,000,000 USD worth of sats to
grantees in 40+ countries, every month. During the course of 2025 we supported
more than 150 active grantees at any point in time: small teams, large teams,
educational efforts, and—most importantly—individual developers.

![](/static/images/blog/2025-eoy/2025-monthly-grant-payouts.svg)

When we reach out to our grantees we ask three simple questions: How did you
spend your time? What are your plans for next quarter? How did you use the
funds? We also follow it up with a fourth: Is there anything we could help with?

As we look back at 2025, it is now our turn to answer these questions.

## Announcements

> How did you spend your time?

Our mission is simple: we want to support and maintain a sustainable ecosystem
of funding for free and open-source projects and contributors, especially
bitcoin-related projects and projects that help bitcoin flourish. Our day-to-day
operations thus consist of the following: receiving grant applications,
evaluating grant applications (in terms of scope, technical feasibility,
clarity, potential impact, and scalability), doing due diligence, and arriving
at a final decision through majority vote. We want to support the best projects
and people. At the same time, we want to avoid wasting donor funds, which is why
we keep a close eye on our grantees to make sure that progress goals and agreed
upon milestones are hit. And last but not least, we are spending our time on
long-term donor relationships and fundraising efforts. After all, we can only
support as many grantees as we do if there are sats in our vaults.

We announce all our grants publicly on our blog, along with our initiatives and
noteworthy donations. Looking at the announcements made in 2025 one should get a
pretty good idea of what we've been up to: In January 2025 we announced
[additional grants for Bitcoin Core contributors](/blog/more-for-core), followed
by a [wave of bitcoin grants](/blog/ninth-wave-of-bitcoin-grants) announced
shortly after. In February we published our first impact report: [Advancements
in On-Chain Privacy](/blog/developing-advancements-in-onchain-privacy). In March
we announced the [10th wave of grants](/blog/tenth-wave-of-bitcoin-grants) from
the General Fund as well as the [10th wave of grants](/blog/10th-wave-of-nostr-grants)
from The Nostr Fund. We also published "[Let a Thousand Flowers
Bloom](/blog/let-a-thousand-flowers-bloom)," outlining our thesis on how to best
scale OpenSats horizontally.

In April we announced our [4th wave of education
grants](/blog/fourth-wave-of-education-grants), followed by [another wave of
nostr grants](/blog/eleventh-wave-of-nostr-grants) and our next impact report:
[Advancements in Lightning Infrastructure](/blog/advancements-in-lightning-infrastructure).
In May we announced yet [another wave of grants](/blog/eleventh-wave-of-bitcoin-grants)
(and grant renewals) from our General Fund.

June marked the release of our third impact report, [Advancements in Developer
Training](/blog/advancements-in-developer-training), highlighting progress of
some of the developer-focused education initiatives we fund: Summer of Bitcoin,
Africa Free Routing, Bitcoin Dev Launchpad, and Bitshala. We also announced our
long-term support for [SnowCait](/blog/snowcait-receives-lts-grant), a prolific
nostr developer. In July we announced the [12th wave of
grants](/blog/twelfth-wave-of-bitcoin-grants) from the General Fund as well as
[The Nostr Fund](/blog/twelfth-wave-of-nostr-grants), respectively.

![](/static/images/blog/2025-eoy/2025-lts.png)

In August we published yet another impact report: [Advancements in Developer
Libraries](/blog/advancements-in-developer-libraries). We fund a lot of projects
that are by their very nature invisible to the end-user. Software development
kits and libraries that a myriad of projects depend upon. BDK, `rust-bitcoin`,
Payjoin Dev Kit, DLC Dev Kit, libraries focused on `secp256k1`, and many others.
Developing and maintaining these libraries is hard and often thankless, but
paramount to a flourishing bitcoin ecosystem. As one of our grantees Tobin
Harding succinctly put it: "My job is to provide libraries so other devs can
create software that users love. If no one ever mentions rust-bitcoin while
simultaneously using it every day, then we win." Our [13th wave of
grants](/blog/thirteenth-wave-of-bitcoin-grants), also announced in August,
showed our commitment to those infrastructure-like software projects: Tor,
Tails, and `ngx_L402` are all puzzle pieces to the larger freedom tech picture.

In September we highlighted what advancements our grantees made on [the ecash
front](/blog/advancements-in-ecash): Cashu, CDK, Nutshell, Minibits, Nutstash,
npub.cash, Hashpool, Fedimint, and OpenCash. We believe that Chaumian ecash has
a large role to play in bitcoin's future, and are proud to support the people
and projects who are pushing this technology forward.

In October we announced the [14th wave of grants](/blog/fourteenth-wave-of-bitcoin-grants)
from our General Fund, followed by an impact report on [Advancements in Bitcoin
and Lightning Wallets](/blog/advancements-in-bitcoin-and-lightning-wallets). In
November we published the [13th wave of nostr
grants](/blog/thirteenth-wave-of-nostr-grants), and we concluded the year in
December with the announcement of the [14th](/blog/fourteenth-wave-of-nostr-grants)
and [15th wave](/blog/fifteenth-wave-of-bitcoin-grants) respectively, as well as
our first impact report focusing on the nostr ecosystem: [Advancements in Nostr
Clients](/blog/advancements-in-nostr-clients). On the last day of the year we
announced our long-term support for [Brad
Stachurski](/blog/brad-stachurski-receives-lts), who was the 2nd LTS recipient
in December, following [Andrew Toth](/blog/andrew-toth-receives-lts-grant).

## Allocation

> How did you use the funds?

OpenSats exists because we want to see contributors to Bitcoin and free and
open-source tools supported by a sustainable ecosystem and consistent funding.
Our LTS program (long-term support) aims to do just that: support the best
people for a multi-year period. Consequently, a lot of our funds are dedicated
to our LTS grantees. In 2025, we allocated a total of \$3,993,949 to long-term
support, up 77% from last year. That said, we allocated almost twice as much to
regular, project-based grants with a total of \$7,094,729 (up 3% from last
year). In total, we have now given over 350 grants since launching our grant
program in 2023.

![](/static/images/blog/2025-eoy/2025-grantee-growth.png)

As mentioned before, we are currently sending approximately \$1 million worth of
bitcoin to our grantees each month. Thanks to the power of magic internet money
we can do this with minimal overhead and near-instant settlement—regardless of
where our grantees are located. As of this writing, our grantees span over 40
countries:

<GranteeMap />

<StatsSentence className="text-xl leading-8 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400" />

Our two funds serve distinct purposes: the [General Fund](/funds/general)
supports bitcoin-related projects and other free and open-source work that
helps bitcoin flourish, while [The Nostr Fund](/funds/nostr) focuses
specifically on the nostr ecosystem.

In 2025, the General Fund allocated \$7,878,735 (up 43% from 2024) and The Nostr
Fund allocated \$3,209,942 (down 12%). Across the lifetime of both programs, we
have now sent over \$18M from the General Fund and over \$11M from The Nostr
Fund.

![](/static/images/blog/2025-eoy/2025-allocation.png)

The convergence between bitcoin and nostr that we noted [last
year](/blog/2024-year-in-review#allocation) has accelerated. Ecash projects
like Cashu now use nostr for coordination and discovery. Wallets integrate
nostr for social payments and contact management. Mining pools experiment with
ecash tokens for anonymous payout mechanisms. These categories blur in practice,
though we maintain separate funds to ensure both ecosystems receive dedicated
support.

### Bitcoin: General Fund

In 2025, our General Fund grants emphasized several key areas: Bitcoin Core
development, Silent Payments infrastructure, Lightning improvements, ecash
tooling, mining decentralization, and developer libraries.

Bitcoin Core support remained central to our allocation. Beyond the LTS grants
for experienced contributors, we funded projects that strengthen the reference
implementation: performance optimizations, testing infrastructure, and the
[Great Script Restoration](/blog/eleventh-wave-of-bitcoin-grants#great-script-restoration)
research effort exploring disabled opcodes.

Silent Payments emerged as a major theme. We supported [Dana
Wallet](/blog/fifteenth-wave-of-bitcoin-grants#dana-wallet), [BlindBit
Suite](/blog/fifteenth-wave-of-bitcoin-grants#blindbit-suite), and the [Silent
Payments Shepherd](/blog/thirteenth-wave-of-bitcoin-grants#silent-payments-shepherd)
coordination project—all working to make reusable addresses practical for
everyday use.

Mining decentralization received substantial attention through grants to the
[256 Foundation](/blog/eleventh-wave-of-bitcoin-grants#256-foundation) (open-source
mining stack), [BitShoka](/blog/eleventh-wave-of-bitcoin-grants#bitshoka) (ASIC
reverse engineering for BitAxe), and
[Hashpool/Axepool](/blog/twelfth-wave-of-bitcoin-grants#hashpool-and-axepool)
(accountless mining pools using ecash). These projects work toward a future
where mining infrastructure is more accessible and less dependent on
proprietary systems.

On the ecash front, we continued supporting the Cashu ecosystem through grants
for [Nutshell](/blog/advancements-in-ecash#nutshell),
[Minibits](/blog/advancements-in-ecash#minibits-wallet),
[Nutstash](/blog/advancements-in-ecash#nutstash), and
[npub.cash](/blog/advancements-in-ecash#npubcash). The [OpenCash
Association](/blog/let-a-thousand-flowers-bloom#opencash) received support to
coordinate development and fund bounties across the ecosystem.

Developer libraries and tooling continued to mature. Our [impact report on
developer libraries](/blog/advancements-in-developer-libraries) detailed
progress across BDK, rust-bitcoin, secp256k1, DLC Dev Kit, Payjoin Dev Kit, and
lnprototest—all foundational projects that other developers build upon.

We also maintained our commitment to privacy infrastructure, including ongoing
support for projects like [KMP-Tor](/blog/thirteenth-wave-of-bitcoin-grants#kmp-tor)
and operating system diversity through
[FreeBSD](/blog/fifteenth-wave-of-bitcoin-grants#freebsd).

You can read more about these projects in our grant announcements from
[January](/blog/more-for-core),
[January](/blog/ninth-wave-of-bitcoin-grants),
[March](/blog/tenth-wave-of-bitcoin-grants),
[May](/blog/eleventh-wave-of-bitcoin-grants),
[July](/blog/twelfth-wave-of-bitcoin-grants),
[August](/blog/thirteenth-wave-of-bitcoin-grants),
[October](/blog/fourteenth-wave-of-bitcoin-grants), and
[December](/blog/fifteenth-wave-of-bitcoin-grants).

### Nostr: The Nostr Fund

The Nostr Fund kept growing. We funded clients, but also infrastructure,
tooling, and some weird stuff nobody expected.

Our [nostr clients impact report](/blog/advancements-in-nostr-clients)
highlighted major advances: Amethyst's transition to the outbox model (enabling
connections to 1,000+ relays while preserving mobile performance), Coracle's
relay membership controls, Damus's Android launch and Notedeck development,
and Zap.stream's mobile live streaming apps.

Key management saw progress through
[Frostr](/blog/twelfth-wave-of-nostr-grants#frostr) (threshold signing using
FROST) and [Aegis](/blog/twelfth-wave-of-nostr-grants#aegis) (cross-platform
signer). These projects address the challenge of securing nostr identities
without sacrificing usability.

Decentralized collaboration advanced through
[Gitplaza](/blog/twelfth-wave-of-nostr-grants#gitplaza) and
[Grasp](/blog/thirteenth-wave-of-nostr-grants#grasp)—both working toward
nostr-native alternatives to centralized code hosting. The Nostr Double Ratchet
project brought Signal-style end-to-end encryption to nostr messaging.

Some of the most creative projects pushed nostr into unexpected territory:
[HAMSTR](/blog/eleventh-wave-of-nostr-grants#hamstr) enables nostr
communication over ham radio for off-grid and censorship-resistant
messaging. [Nostr Game Engine](/blog/eleventh-wave-of-nostr-grants#nostr-game-engine)
provides game developers with nostr-native infrastructure. [Atomic Signature
Swaps](/blog/twelfth-wave-of-nostr-grants#atomic-signature-swaps) enables
trustless exchange of Schnorr signatures between nostr, bitcoin, and Cashu.

Long-term support grantees—including
[fiatjaf](/blog/fiatjaf-receives-lts-grant),
[Vitor Pamplona](/blog/vitor-pamplona-receives-lts-grant),
[Hodlbod](/blog/hodlbod-receives-lts-grant),
[Kieran](/blog/kieran-receives-lts-grant), and
[hzrd149](/blog/hzrd149-receives-lts-grant)—continued their foundational work
on protocol development, client infrastructure, and ecosystem tooling. The
addition of [SnowCait](/blog/snowcait-receives-lts-grant) in June strengthened
our support for Japanese nostr development.

You can read more about these projects in our grant announcements from
[March](/blog/10th-wave-of-nostr-grants),
[April](/blog/eleventh-wave-of-nostr-grants),
[July](/blog/twelfth-wave-of-nostr-grants),
[November](/blog/thirteenth-wave-of-nostr-grants), and
[December](/blog/fourteenth-wave-of-nostr-grants).

## Donations

> Is there anything we could help with?

2025 was a good year for donations. Individuals and organizations both showed up.

The [Human Rights Foundation](/blog/additional-ops-budget-from-hrf) contributed
\$250,000 to our Operations Budget, allowing us to maintain the organizational
infrastructure that makes our grant-giving possible. The [Reynolds
Foundation](/blog/opensats-receives-two-million-donation-from-the-reynolds-foundation)
followed up their 2024 gift with an additional \$2,000,000 donation to our
General Fund.

In October, [Tether](/blog/opensats-receives-dollar250k-donation-from-tether)
donated \$250,000, and [StarkWare together with the Starknet
Foundation](/blog/opensats-receives-dollar400k-donation-from-starkware-starknet)
contributed \$400,000—both directed to our General Fund. Bitcoin's open-source
foundation needs sustained investment, and these donors stepped up.

We also received our first bitcoin-denominated recurring commitment when [Steak
'n Shake](/blog/opensats-receives-donation-commitment-from-steak-n-shake)
announced they would donate 210 sats from every Bitcoin Meal sold over the
next twelve months. We hope other companies follow their lead.

In terms of individual donations, bitcoin payment rails continue to dominate.
The ratio of Lightning to on-chain payments remained steady at approximately
70% Lightning. The vast majority of donations continue to flow to our [General
Fund](/funds/general), with the remainder split between [The Nostr
Fund](/funds/nostr) and our [Operations Budget](/funds/ops).

100% of donations to our General Fund and The Nostr Fund go directly to
grantees. Our operations are funded separately. When you donate, your money
reaches developers.

## Outlook

> What are your plans for next quarter?

Where to go from here? Allow me to quote our mission statement: OpenSats is a
501(c)(3) public charity that aims to support and maintain a *sustainable*
ecosystem of funding for free and open-source projects and contributors,
especially bitcoin-related projects and projects that help bitcoin flourish.
Emphasis mine.

Sustainability has multiple dimensions. We want to keep doing what we've been
doing in the leanest way possible, without burning out. We want to continue to
offer long-term support for load-bearing internet people, providing at least
some stability in an otherwise uncertain world. We want to stay true to our
principles, which means not taking a cut from donations to our funds, raising
funding for our operational budget separately.

Bitcoin continues to mature as both technology and asset. Silent Payments
infrastructure is moving from specification to production. Ecash protocols are
gaining real users and merchant adoption. Mining decentralization efforts are
producing open hardware and accountless pool designs. The projects we support
are building the foundation for bitcoin's next decade.

Nostr has established itself as viable infrastructure for censorship-resistant
communication. The outbox model is proving that decentralized social networks
can work at scale. Clients are shipping features that rival centralized
platforms while preserving user control. The integration between nostr, bitcoin,
and ecash creates new possibilities for value transfer and identity that
didn't exist a year ago.

What needs funding in 2026?

**Protocol research and implementation.** Projects like LNHANCE are exploring
covenant constructions that could enable new types of channels and vaults.
Silent Payments tooling needs to reach maturity across major wallets. Ecash
protocols require ongoing standardization and security review.

**Infrastructure maintenance.** Developer libraries like BDK, rust-bitcoin, and
the various nostr SDKs underpin hundreds of applications. These projects need
sustained support for maintenance, security fixes, and compatibility updates.

**Developer onboarding.** Programs like Summer of Bitcoin, Bitcoin Dev
Launchpad, and Bitshala are training the next generation of contributors.
Education initiatives in underserved regions expand bitcoin's reach and
strengthen its resilience through geographic diversity.

**Ecosystem building.** The organizations we funded through "Let a Thousand
Flowers Bloom" are establishing funding infrastructure in new jurisdictions and
domains. We hope to see more nonprofits emerge to support open-source
development—the ecosystem benefits from multiple funding sources with different
focuses and perspectives.

Our goal remains the same: maintain a sustainable ecosystem of funding for free
and open-source projects. We rely on donations to fund our operations and the
projects we support. If you believe in what we're doing, please consider
supporting us:

We are grateful to everyone who contributed to OpenSats in 2025—whether through
donations, volunteer time, or simply spreading the word. Our grantees produced
meaningful work this year: code merged, protocols shipped, and users served.
This progress happens because people choose to support open-source development.

To our donors: thank you for making this possible. To our grantees: thank you
for the work you do. To everyone building, learning, and using freedom tech:
you are what makes this ecosystem worth supporting.

Here's to 2026. Onwards.
