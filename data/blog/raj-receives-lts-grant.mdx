OpenSats is proud to announce long-term support for [Raj
Maitra](https://github.com/rajarshimaitra), who has picked up the mantle of the
[CoinSwap](https://github.com/citadel-tech/coinswap/blob/master/docs/dev-book.md?rgh-link-date=2024-05-06T14%3A32%3A12Z)
project initiated by Gregory Maxwell and carried forward by [Chris
Belcher](https://gist.github.com/chris-belcher).

CoinSwaps, also known as
[utxo-teleport/teleport-transactions](https://github.com/utxo-teleport/teleport-transactions),
use HTLCs to enable atomic swaps between UTXOs for two or more anonymous
participants. Implemented Coinswaps would significantly increase base privacy
levels in Bitcoin.

Our [LTS grants](/blog/announcing-lts-grant-program-to-support-bitcoin-core-contributors)
are awarded to individuals or projects making significant contributions to the
open-source ecosystem within Bitcoin and Nostr, and we are excited to extend our
support to Raj to move this important project forward.

Raj has a prolific pedigree contributing to BDK (supported by a Spiral Dev
Grant), running the technical track at Bitcoin4India, and has been foundational
in building a Bitcoin Developer education academy for India and Southeast Asia,
[bitshala.org](https://bitshala.org/). Raj has been working on CoinSwap
as a Lead Dev and Project Manager since July 2023.

This LTS grant will enable Raj to focus on several critical developments:

- Taproot + MuSig Scripts to have an anonymity set for all Taproot Single-sig transactions.
- BDK Integration so the swap client can be easily integrated into any BDK-based wallet.
- Developing a P2P DNS protocol to create a censorship-resistant Swap marketplace.

Additionally, there is potential for future work to extend CoinSwap to enable
cross-chain atomic swaps between Liquid and Bitcoin, further enhancing liquidity
and privacy for users.

> Coinswap will provide network-wide passive privacy to all users, and is
> potentially the most important privacy project ongoing in the current Bitcoin
> ecosystem

Our mission at OpenSats is to provide sustainable funding for those who work on
the freedom tech of tomorrow. We believe that free and open-source software
tools in general, and Bitcoin and Nostr in particular, are essential to the
future of the internet and the world.

Our [Long-Term Support program](/tags/lts) is made possible by generous donors
like you. To help us continue supporting important open-source contributors like
Raj, consider making a donation to the [General Fund](/funds/general) from which
Bitcoin projects are supported.
