We are pleased to announce our latest wave of grants supporting the nostr
ecosystem as it evolves to become more versatile and resilient. At the heart of
this evolution is a diverse set of tools that strengthen nostr's utility, from
secure key management and signing workflows to decentralized collaboration and
user-centric relay experiences.

This round of funding features five first-time grants for projects advancing the
protocol in identity management, secure signing, decentralized collaboration,
relay discovery, and cross-protocol integration:

- [Frostr](#frostr)
- [Aegis](#aegis)
- [Gitplaza](#gitplaza)
- [Jumble](#jumble)
- [Atomic Signature Swaps](#atomic-signature-swaps)

In addition, we've also renewed funding for four projects that continue to make
critical contributions across the nostr ecosystem:

- [Damus](/blog/nostr-grants-july-2023#damus)
- [Camelus](/blog/nostr-grants-december-2023#camelus)
- [Nostromo](/blog/nostr-grants-july-2024#nostrmo)
- [Nostroots](/blog/nostr-grants-august-2024#nostroots)

This support is made possible by donors who believe in an open,
censorship-resistant communications layer for the internet—and the builders
who are making that a reality.

Our nostr grants are sourced from [The Nostr Fund](/funds/nostr). To help us
support the nostr ecosystem, please consider making a donation.

### Frostr

[Frostr](https://www.frostr.org/) is a threshold signing protocol tailored for
nostr, built on the [FROST](https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/852) (Flexible
Round‑Optimized Schnorr Threshold) signature scheme. It provides security by
splitting a user's nsec key into distributable shares across devices or
services, enabling
[threshold‑of‑n](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threshold_cryptosystem) signing
with strong fault tolerance. Frostr leverages nostr relays to coordinate
signing: each share maintains its own nostr identity and exchanges encrypted
direct messages via
[nostrp2p](https://ryogrid.github.io/tech-entry/about-nostrp2p.html), allowing
seamless, background coordination over any relay. With libraries like Frost,
[Bifrost](https://github.com/FROSTR-ORG/bifrost), and nostrp2p nearly complete
and clients such as Igloo, Frost2x, Heimdall, Frostbite, and Permafrost under
development, Frostr already enables multi-device signing, key rotation, and
share replacement—crucial features nostr users need for secure, flexible
identity management.

With support from this grant, Frostr aims to reach full maturity over the next
year. In the next phase, the project will finalize UX and releases for
[Igloo](https://github.com/FROSTR-ORG/igloo-desktop) and
[Frost2x](https://github.com/FROSTR-ORG/frost2x), then build out Heimdall
(REST‑API signing), full mobile support via Frostbite, and self‑hostable signing
with Permafrost. It will integrate a
[NIP-46](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/46.md) bridge for
compatibility with remote‑signing workflows, complete a security audit, and
introduce advanced features like `sign_psbt` for interactive bitcoin p2p protocols
over nostr. These enhancements will help to solidify Frostr as the standard for
resilient, multi‑device, and interoperable key management and signing in the
nostr ecosystem—enabling private identity recovery, remote signing, and the
groundwork for next‑gen protocols like coinjoins, and Payjoins over nostr.

### Aegis

Aegis is a lightweight, cross-platform nostr signer that offers a seamless and
secure experience across mobile and desktop environments. Initially launched for
iOS and available through TestFlight, Aegis enables persistent background
connections, critical for maintaining uninterrupted signing sessions,
especially on mobile devices. Built using
[Flutter](https://github.com/flutter/flutter), it supports a variety of
connection methods and introduces simple nostr key management in a user-friendly
interface. The project fills a gap in the nostr ecosystem by offering a signer
that's actively maintained and easy to integrate.

With support from this grant, Aegis will expand to Android, macOS, Windows, and
Linux platforms, bringing secure signing to a much broader user base.
Development plans include multi-account support, a request history interface,
and enhanced login options. The project will also explore user permission
controls for more secure request handling. Long term, Aegis aims to become a
reliable, device-agnostic signer for the nostr protocol, with continuous
improvements made through community feedback and iterative development.

### Gitplaza

Gitplaza is a decentralized, desktop-based alternative to GitHub built on the
nostr protocol. It enables issue creation, [kanban
board](https://codeberg.org/dluvian/gitplaza/src/branch/master/screenshots/themed_kanban_board.gif)
management, profile browsing, and repository viewing—all designed to function
offline by storing data locally. By removing central points of control, Gitplaza
addresses the systemic risks of censorship and data loss inherent in centralized
code hosting. Its goal is to reimagine collaborative development as a resilient,
user-sovereign process.

With support from this grant, Gitplaza will expand core functionality to include
pull requests, notifications, search, upvoting, repo wikis, milestones, and
release publishing—mirroring key GitHub features. Development will also
include features like multi-account login, tagging, and richer activity feeds.
Longer-term goals include integrating nostr-native tools like zaps, web-of-trust
filtering, and ecash support, laying the groundwork for a robust,
censorship-resistant hub for open-source collaboration.

### Jumble

[Jumble](https://jumble.social/) is a nostr client designed for streamlined
relay browsing and discovery. Available as a Progressive Web App
([PWA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_web_app)), it supports relay
feed browsing, relay set management, a minimalist interface, and efficient relay
interactions—all while prioritizing user simplicity and relay diversity. After
six months in development, Jumble delivers a stable user experience and remains
a practical option for those exploring the growing landscape of nostr relays.

With support from this grant, Jumble will continue developing core functionality
and promote relay network growth. Priorities include improved relay
discovery—such as surfacing relays followed by your network, rating systems,
favorites, and advanced search—and user experience upgrades like a richer post
editor, bookmarks, emoji support, optimized feed loading, and better video
playback. The roadmap outlines a year of focused development to refine
usability, expand relay-centric features, and ensure the client keeps pace as
more specialized relays come online.

### Atomic Signature Swaps

[Atomic Signature Swaps over
nostr](https://github.com/vstabile/nips/blob/atomic-signature-swaps/XX.md) is a
protocol designed to enable the trustless exchange of Schnorr signatures using
nostr events. By leveraging adaptor signatures, the project creates a
cryptographic bridge between nostr, bitcoin (via Taproot), and Cashu, allowing
for atomic swaps across these ecosystems. This mechanism unlocks new
capabilities, such as allowing creators to monetize their content by getting
paid to publish specific events, issuing automatic payment receipts, and
facilitating decentralized peer-to-peer asset exchanges.

With support from this grant, the project will focus on developing a reference
implementation that allows users to monetize their nostr accounts through
sponsored notes paid for with [Cashu](https://cashu.space/). This initial work
will serve to validate and refine the protocol's formal specification as a Nostr
Implementation Possibility
([NIP](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips?tab=readme-ov-file#nips)). Key
milestones include creating a TypeScript library to facilitate adoption by other
developers, integrating the protocol into popular wallets and clients, and
actively promoting the protocol through educational outreach to encourage
innovation and new use cases.
