We are thrilled to announce our third wave of [education grants][edu], dedicated
to advancing Bitcoin literacy and community development across the globe. These
grants represent our ongoing commitment to supporting projects that make Bitcoin
education more accessible, practical, and inspiring.

Whether it's building foundational knowledge, driving merchant adoption, or
creating engaging content, each project in this wave aims to empower individuals
and communities with the tools and understanding needed to participate in the
growing Bitcoin ecosystem.

This wave of grants is made possible by the generosity of our donors, whose
support enables us to fund impactful educational initiatives.  We are grateful
for their commitment and hope these initiatives will empower a wide base of
current and future Bitcoin users.

Educational content produced under [these grants][edu-wave] will be published
under permissive and open licenses, ensuring it remains accessible to everyone.

Here are the four projects receiving grants in this wave:

- [BTC Map](#btc-map)
- [Yes Bitcoin Haiti](#yes-bitcoin-haiti)
- [Entropy Bitcoin Education](#entropy-bitcoin-education)
- [Bitcoin 4all](#bitcoin-4all)

Each of these projects brings unique value to the global Bitcoin community. We
are proud to support their efforts and look forward to seeing the impact they
will have in their respective regions and beyond.

[mission](/mission).

### BTC Map

[BTC Map](https://btcmap.org/) is an initiative to create a global directory of
Bitcoin-accepting merchants, fostering circular Bitcoin economies worldwide. BTC
Map uses OpenStreetMap as its geographic database, allowing community members to
add and verify merchant data. With a core team and a wider network of
volunteers, the project has verified over 10,000 locations and added hundreds of
local communities to its platform. BTC Map focuses on simplifying merchant
discovery to drive Bitcoin adoption globally.

With this grant, BTC Map plans to expand its reach by enhancing existing
features and introducing new ones, such as service listings and verifiable
merchant reviews. It will also work on community-driven data maintenance, mobile
codebase consolidation, and the development of tools for a more robust,
decentralized merchant network.

### Yes Bitcoin Haiti

Yes Bitcoin Haiti was founded to establish a Bitcoin circular economy in Haiti.
The project focuses on Bitcoin education and merchant adoption, targeting
unbanked communities and leveraging free educational resources like Mi Primer
Bitcoin. It aims to foster financial inclusion through Bitcoin, enabling faster,
low-cost transactions and empowering local communities.

With the support of this grant, Yes Bitcoin Haiti plans to build an education
center, expand Bitcoin adoption among businesses, and deliver a Bitcoin Diploma
program to 50 students. The grant will also facilitate community workshops and
merchant onboarding, helping the project create a sustainable Bitcoin ecosystem
in the region.

### Entropy Bitcoin Education

[Entropy](https://entropy.page/pow.html) Bitcoin Education is dedicated to
making Bitcoin education fun, interactive, and globally accessible. By using
gamified workshops, open-source tools, and programming bootcamps, the project
simplifies complex Bitcoin concepts, enabling engagement across diverse age
groups and technical skill levels. It aims to make educational tools widely
available to amplify global impact.

This grant will allow Entropy to refine and document its workshops, making them
more replicable for other educators. Plans include launching a "train the
trainer" initiative, expanding gamified content, and integrating new tools like
"Running Bitcoin" and "Who Wants to Be a Satoshi Millionaire?" to reach a
broader audience and promote interactive learning.

### Bitcoin 4all

Bitcoin 4all is an educational project delivering foundational Bitcoin knowledge
through comprehensive, free video content. The project will offer six hours of
material divided into short, digestible lessons in English, Spanish, and
Portuguese. The content will be available for global use, adaptation, and
distribution, supporting educators in fostering Bitcoin literacy across diverse
communities.

With this grant, Bitcoin 4all will develop scripts, videos, and support
materials. The project will focus on recording and editing content, with plans
to distribute it through meetups, conferences, and online channels. The aim is
to provide versatile, copyright-free educational resources that accelerate and
support global Bitcoin education initiatives.
