summary: "An impact report from the front-lines of nostr client development."
---

Free speech on the internet depends on open, uncensorable communication
infrastructure that keeps users in control. OpenSats launched [The Nostr
Fund](/funds/nostr) in 2023 to support the nostr ecosystem building this
infrastructure, and since then [we have funded](/tags/nostr) work on protocol
development, developer tooling, relays, and a wide range of clients.

Nostr is a simple, open protocol for publishing and receiving signed messages,
relayed by independent servers, not a single platform. The design is
intentionally minimal: clients handle keys and signatures, and relays store and
forward events. Anyone can run a client or a relay, and people are free to move
between them without abandoning their identity or social graph. In his original
2019 [white paper](https://fiatjaf.com/nostr.html) introducing nostr, fiatjaf
described it as:

> The simplest open protocol that is able to create a censorship-resistant
> global 'social' network once and for all.
>
><cite>—fiatjaf</cite>

Nostr shifts power toward users. A nostr identity is a keypair, not an account
on a single site. If one client blocks or censors someone, removes features, or
changes in ways they cannot accept, the user signs in to another client with the
same keys. Their history, relationships, and audience move with them; they are
not trapped inside any one application.

The same simple protocol that routes nostr posts can also route bitcoin between
users via Lightning zaps. Many clients treat zaps as a native social action, and
to date, [statistics show](https://stats.nostr.band/) users have sent millions
of zaps, totaling more than 2.6 billion sats, directly to one another over
nostr.

This impact report focuses on seven nostr clients with different approaches to
product design and a shared commitment to openness, interoperability, and user
sovereignty. Their progress shows how donor support translates into concrete
improvements for people who rely on nostr for communication, coordination, and
value transfer.

The seven clients highlighted in this report are:

- [Amethyst](#amethyst)
- [Coracle](#coracle)
- [Damus](#damus)
- [Jumble](#jumble)
- [NoStrudel](#nostrudel)
- [Nostur](#nostur)
- [Zap.stream](#zapstream)

Let's take a closer look at how each of these clients has evolved over the past
year and how donor funding supported their work.

### Amethyst

[Amethyst] is a long-running Android client for nostr, built with an emphasis on
speed, resilience, and everyday use. Over the past year, work on the project
focused on three areas: making relay use more automatic and robust, tightening
private communication, and adding new ways for people to post and discover
content inside the app. With support from OpenSats, [Vitor Pamplona] shipped a
series of releases that changed how Amethyst talks to relays, how it handles
private media, and how users explore what is happening on nostr.

The biggest shift came from moving Amethyst from a manual relay-list model to a
dynamic [outbox model]. In older versions, users had to maintain their own lists
of relays—the independent servers that store and forward nostr posts—and tell
the app where to read from. If someone they followed moved to a different relay
and the user did not update their list, posts simply stopped appearing, often
without any clear indication that something was wrong. The outbox model flips
that burden. Instead of asking users to guess which relays to read from,
Amethyst now compiles the needed relay set automatically based on the user's
actual follows and content. This was implemented in [v1.03.0], along with an
updated Relay List interface that lets users focus on where their own notes are
published while the client assembles an effective read set in the background.

That change is not just a user-experience improvement; it also shifts how
traffic flows across the network. Under the old approach, most activity ended up
concentrated on 10--20 major relays, which made nostr more fragile than it
appears on paper. With the outbox model, Amethyst can connect to as many as
1,000 relays at once, even over mobile data, and fetch posts directly from
smaller or personal relays when needed. It does this without noticeably
increasing data usage, which is important for people on limited connections or
inexpensive phones. In practice, it shows that a mobile client can participate
in a broad relay set rather than depending on a handful of large hubs. The
outbox model is also wired into Amethyst's embedded Tor support, which is
enabled by default, so these connections do not have to reveal a user's IP
address to relay operators. Over time, that makes it more difficult to track
users by IP or location across the relays they interact with.

Private messaging saw a similar step forward. With [v0.94.0], Amethyst added
encrypted media in direct messages (DMs) so users can share images and files in
one-to-one conversations without leaving the nostr stack. The upload feature was
reworked to handle multiple files and encrypted delivery, making it easier to
send sensitive material in a way that is both convenient and private. This
builds on earlier work that helped establish [NIP-17] as the newer
direct-messaging standard, closing metadata leaks that were present in the older
[NIP-04] design. Taken together, encrypted media and the newer DM format make
private communication on nostr substantially harder to track or analyze from the
outside.

Discovery features also evolved. Version [0.93.0] introduced support for image
feeds from Olas, a photo-focused nostr service, an "Around Me" feed that
highlights posts tied to the user's approximate location, and [NIP-63]
interactive stories. These additions allow users to browse photos in a focused
stream, see what is happening nearby, or tap through story-style posts that feel
closer to what mainstream social apps already offer. In the same release,
Amethyst moved picture and video uploads to the newer [NIP-68] and [NIP-71]
standards so that media handling matches the latest expectations across the
ecosystem.

> This achievement (outbox transition and relay changes) is a major
> demonstration of the true decentralized potential of nostr. By enabling mobile
> clients to automatically connect to 1,000 relays, we have fundamentally
> shifted the narrative. We've proven that users can be reliably served by a
> highly distributed network—not just a few central points.
>
> <cite>—Vitor Pamplona</cite>

Over the past year, Amethyst has become a more decentralized, private, and
expressive way to use nostr from an Android phone. The outbox model removed much
of the manual relay management that used to frustrate users, encrypted media
made private conversations safer, and richer content options made the app more
engaging for everyday use. OpenSats support made it possible to pursue these
longer-term improvements in a sustained way, strengthening both Amethyst itself
and the broader nostr ecosystem.

### Coracle

[Coracle] is a web-based nostr client designed to make decentralized social
networking approachable without sacrificing flexibility or user choice. Over the
past year, development has focused on stronger relay controls, smoother
synchronization, and improvements that make the [outbox model] easier for
everyday users to understand. With OpenSats' support, [Hodlbod] and [Daniele]
delivered upgrades that make nostr communication more reliable and practical
while pushing forward a clearer model of what relays are for.

A major milestone for Hodlbod's relay work was the merging of [NIP-43] and its
implementation in the [zooid] relay, enabling relays to publish and maintain
their own membership lists: a relay can sign a list of members, accept join
requests from users, and update that list over time. The [NIP-86] implementation
complements this by giving relay administrators a separate interface to add or
remove members. Together, these features formalize a pattern in which relays are
services with clear access controls and content curation policies. In other
words, a relay can explicitly state who it is for and what kind of content it
hosts.

Coracle's 0.6.x releases added a compose option that lets users choose which
relays will receive a posted note. This gives authors direct control over
distribution instead of relying on a handful of large relays, and it makes the
outbox model tangible: users decide where their posts are published, and the
client manages the rest. These releases also introduced proof-of-work display
and generation, as well as editing tools for web-of-trust feeds, expanding the
ways users can shape what they see and how their content propagates.

Additional development work by Daniele strengthened Coracle's day-to-day
reliability. Version [0.6.26] introduced outbox-friendly relay controls, clearer
publishing behavior, and smarter fallback mechanisms that keep the client
connected even when individual relays fail. These adjustments reduce the number
of instances where users encounter missing posts or slow-loading timelines and
help Coracle maintain a consistent experience across a diverse relay set. The
same release restored a global feed with performance improvements---an easy
entry point for browsing the wider network without impacting advanced filtering
tools.

Sync performance also received attention. Improvements to [negentropy]—the
protocol's method for reconciling differences between client and relay
state—made timelines feel faster and more predictable, especially when switching
between relays or refreshing a busy feed. These changes reduce wait times and
help users understand what is happening on the network.

> Much of nostr's novelty has to do with keys and digital signatures. But
> focusing on the cryptographic aspects is, to me, actually something of a
> distraction. The important thing to realize is that digital signatures make
> relays possible—I mean this in the sense that digital signatures decouple data
> storage from data authentication. This means that the same information can be
> stored in multiple places—whether relays, local files, torrents, or anywhere
> else—and the names associated with these places lose their power and become
> far less meaningful. This puts the user in control, by allowing them to select
> and move between services and custodians, with support from the protocol for
> doing so.
>
> <cite>—Hodlbod</cite>

Coracle has progressively improved how users read and publish notes from the
browser. Per-note relay selection and outbox-aware relay controls let people
choose where their notes are stored and retrieved instead of relying on a single
default relay list. Negentropy-based sync, smarter fallback behavior when
individual relays are slow, overloaded, or offline, and a restored global feed
reduce missing posts and slow-loading timelines while making it easier to
explore the wider network. With OpenSats' support, Hodlbod and Daniele focused
on these deeper improvements to make the user experience more reliable overall
while staying true to nostr's decentralized relay model.

### Damus

[Damus] is a nostr client for iOS and Android that gives users a social feed
with integrated support for Lightning zaps. [Notedeck] is a related multi-column
client from the same team for desktop and Android, designed for heavier activity
and parallel monitoring of multiple timelines.

Through [several rounds of support] from OpenSats beginning in [July 2023],
contributors worked across these Damus clients to improve localization, show
where notes are stored and propagated, improve spam resistance, and [integrate
Nostr Wallet Connect] and zaps directly into the core client workflow.
Contributors [Terry Yiu], [Eric Holguin], [KernelKind], and [Will Casarin]
focused on localization, relay visibility, moderation tools, Lightning
integration, and platform infrastructure spanning both clients.

Terry Yiu's work on localization ensured that Notedeck's Android launch shipped
with a complete translation system. He also improved how Damus displays nostr's
relay architecture. On iOS, each note posted can show how many relays carried
it, which specific relays saw it, and relay hints embedded in links and tags.
When a note does not appear in a user's feed, they can see whether it failed to
reach their relays or whether the issue lies elsewhere. This shifts relay
behavior from an invisible implementation detail to something users can inspect,
which matters for a protocol that relies on many independent operators.

To address spam and low-quality replies without introducing centralized
moderation, Terry implemented a [web-of-trust reply sorter] in Damus iOS.
Replies from people in a user's social graph are prioritized, while others
remain available but visually deprioritized. The filtering is client-side and
opt-in, so anyone can still publish and read, but users gain more control over
what appears in dense threads.

Eric Holguin focused on the bridge between nostr activity and Lightning
payments. His redesign of the Damus wallet view adds a clear Nostr Wallet
Connect integration, including visible balances, recent transactions, and a zap
explainer. Users can see what funds are available, how they move, and what it
means to send a zap. This reduces the friction of connecting a wallet and makes
Lightning behavior legible.

Eric also [integrated] support for follow packs into Damus, along with a
dedicated timeline in the Universe view. Follow packs, popularized by Calle's
[following.space project], are curated sets of accounts that users can subscribe
to in a single action. When a new user's first nostr experience is an empty
feed, discovery itself becomes a barrier to adoption. Follow packs address that
problem using open data structures: they are visible, shareable, and easy to
extend or unsubscribe from, ultimately improving discovery. Damus iOS also added
interest-based follow suggestions to help new users discover relevant accounts
during onboarding.

On desktop, KernelKind extended the same Lightning and usability focus into
Notedeck's multi-column environment. Full Nostr Wallet Connect support is now
[integrated directly into columns]: users connect their wallet using a Nostr
Wallet Connect link, view balances, configure default zap amounts, and send zaps
from timelines through both the wallet view and directly from each note in the
timeline. This makes value transfer part of the normal reading and replying
process.

KernelKind also [reworked thread rendering] in Notedeck. These changes make
conversations easier to follow and reduce the friction of navigating long,
branching discussions. Replies are now structured so that only direct responses
appear under the selected note, reply chains are shown in order, unread markers
highlight new activity, and navigation makes it easy to move between a specific
branch and the broader context. This improves the readability of long
discussions, including technical discussions and project coordination, and makes
it more feasible to keep those conversations on nostr rather than relying on
proprietary platforms.

In addition, KernelKind [implemented a notifications view] in Notedeck based on
the Damus iOS design. It delivers real-time alerts for reactions and reposts
with the same interaction patterns users know from Damus iOS, while running on a
Rust-based architecture tuned for efficiency on low-end devices. Notedeck now
groups these interactions, shows unseen indicators, and fixes navigation issues
that previously led to dead ends when tapping a notification. This brings a
familiar notifications experience to Notedeck and makes it clearer when people
interact with posts.

> We are working toward the Notedeck browser-platform vision: an open path for
> developers to build on Notedeck without reinventing the wheel. OpenSats
> accelerated this critical step toward a truly decentralized social ecosystem.
>
> <cite>—KernelKind</cite>

A major architectural change this year was the continued development of
[NostrDB], the event database originally built for Damus iOS. NostrDB now
underpins Damus Android and Notedeck and is being adopted by other nostr
applications, including [AirChat] and software built on [rust-nostr-sdk]. This
turns what began as an internal performance improvement into shared
infrastructure available to the broader ecosystem.

At the platform level, Will Casarin advanced the Damus roadmap on Android and
experimented with features that reduce dependency on public relays. The [Damus
Android launch] delivered a native client with the familiar multi-column
Notedeck interface and an integrated assistant to the mobile platform. In many
regions, Android devices are the primary or only computing environment, so
supporting them is important for growing a global user base.

Will's addition of local-network posting introduced a local sharing mode
([multicasting]) that lets Notedeck apps on the same Wi-Fi network share notes
directly with each other without depending on public relays. This is useful at
conferences, meetups, and in locations with poor or intermittent connectivity,
and it demonstrates that nostr-style messaging can operate across different
layers. Reducing reliance on remote infrastructure improves resilience and gives
communities more options for how and where they host their communication.

Finally, Notedeck [added algorithmic timelines], including a view that shows the
last note per npub, supported by improvements to how timelines are stored and
refreshed. These views allow users to create more focused feeds that reduce
distractions without hiding the underlying data or delegating ranking decisions
to a centralized service. Users can choose how to see information from their
network, combining chronological feeds with higher-signal perspectives when
needed.

Across mobile and desktop, Damus and Notedeck now give nostr users a consistent
way to read, publish, and move value on the devices they already use.
Localization expanded access, relay visibility and web-of-trust sorting gave
users more insight and control, Nostr Wallet Connect and zaps integrated bitcoin
directly into everyday use, and Android support plus local-network multicasting
expanded where and how people can participate. The evolution of Notedeck as a
reusable Rust codebase offers a foundation other nostr applications can build
on. OpenSats' support allowed these contributors to spend sustained time
improving the code that strengthens both the nostr ecosystem and the broader
goal of user-controlled infrastructure.

### Jumble

[Jumble] is a browser-based nostr client focused on helping users understand,
choose, and interact with relays in a way that supports decentralization rather
than defaulting to a few large relays. Its design centers on relay quality and
user choice. Over the past year, with [support from OpenSats], developer [Cody
Tseng] has added features that improve relay discovery, key handling, and
control over where notes are published.

One of the most visible changes was the [introduction of relay reviews] and
featured relays in Jumble's Explore experience. Users can now rate the relays
they use and browse relays that the app highlights based on reliability,
responsiveness, or specialization. This replaces the guesswork that many
newcomers face—trying to find a usable relay set from scattered community
lists—and turns relay selection into something closer to a reputation system. By
making well-run relays more discoverable and poor-performing ones easier to
avoid, Jumble encourages users to rely less on a small set of large relays and
instead distribute traffic across many smaller or specialized operators. These
changes were implemented alongside improvements to relay ordering and overall
discovery UX, offering a more intuitive way to explore the network.

Jumble also improved key safety and multi-app interoperability by adding
client-initiated [NIP-46] connections. Instead of pasting a private key into the
browser, users can now pair Jumble with an external signer (such as [Amber],
[Aegis], or [nos2x]) that holds the users' public and private key pairs. This
reduces the risk of account takeover and makes it easier to use the same signer
safely across multiple nostr apps. It replaces the old pattern of pasting
private keys into the client directly and encourages a safer login workflow for
people who use nostr on several devices or through several apps.

Finally, Jumble added outbox-aware publishing and event republishing controls.
Users can now send or resend notes to specific relays, ensuring that posts reach
the communities or topic-focused relays most relevant to them. This is
especially helpful for specialized relays that host conversations around
particular subjects, or for routing around outages or policy changes on
individual relays. Giving users direct control over where their posts go helps
break dependence on a small set of large relays and advances the broader shift
toward the inbox/outbox model many nostr clients are adopting. It also gives
users a clearer sense of how their posts move through the network and how relay
choice affects visibility.

Jumble now gives users more insight and deliberate control in a protocol built
on independent relay operators. Relay reviews and featured relays improve
discovery, NIP-46 login flows make key handling safer without sacrificing
interoperability, and targeted publishing aligns Jumble with nostr's emerging
decentralization patterns. OpenSats' support allowed Cody Tseng to pursue these
deeper improvements, helping Jumble move from a power-user tool toward a client
that makes relay choice and safety understandable for everyone.

### NoStrudel

[NoStrudel] is a web-based nostr client aimed at more technically inclined users
who want a transparent view into how the protocol works while still having
access to the features expected of a modern social application. It places a
strong emphasis on local-first data, clear visibility into relay behavior, and
support for emerging nostr standards. Over the past year, [OpenSats'
support](/blog/hzrd149-receives-lts-grant) has helped noStrudel developer
[hzrd149] improve private messaging, interoperability with other clients, and
refine the underlying engine that powers the app.

In the recent noStrudel [v0.45.0 release], the client added full support for
[NIP-17], a newer standard for private messages on nostr, and [NIP-59] gift
wrap, an extra layer that lets these messages travel across relays without
exposing who the messages are for. NoStrudel also added a dedicated inbox view
for this message format, so users see a straightforward chat interface even
though the protocol working underneath is more complex. This brought noStrudel
into alignment with other major clients such as Amethyst, [0xChat], Coracle,
[Flotilla], and [Coop], allowing users to carry private conversations seamlessly
across apps. In practice, it means encrypted, interoperable messaging that
behaves consistently no matter which client their contacts use.

NoStrudel also received a major internal upgrade through the [applesauce v4.x]
releases, which packages its core components into a shared library for building
nostr web clients. Maintained by hzrd149, the [applesauce] SDK provides relay
connections, timelines, signing, contacts, mutes, bookmarks, and NIP-17
direct-message support, along with newer protocol features such as more
efficient syncing using [NIP-77] and improved counting with [NIP-45]. Because
applesauce is a shared library, other developers can reuse it instead of
rebuilding these parts from scratch, helping new clients ship stable features
faster. For noStrudel itself, using applesauce has already led to a cleaner
split between the app and its engine, and recent work with the library has laid
the groundwork for moving from a [hard-coded relay list] to an outbox model that
builds timelines from the relays used by a user's contacts.

> The biggest achievement has been building out the applesauce SDK to be the
> core of the app. This has allowed me to build and test features in isolation
> and then integrate them back into the app when I know they are working.
>
> <cite>—Hzrd149</cite>

A complementary set of tools expanded noStrudel's focus on local-first data. The
introduction of [window.nostrdb.js], the [Nostr Bucket] browser extension, and
[Umbrel Blob Box]—also developed by hzrd149—gives noStrudel access to locally
stored events/posts and self-hosted media storage. These components allow the
client to load timelines more quickly, reduce dependence on remote databases,
and store images and files under the user's control. Users running noStrudel on
[StartOS], [UmbrelOS], or in the browser gain the option to host their own
media, keep data local, and build a more private and resilient setup without
relying on third-party indexing services.

Over the past year, these efforts have made noStrudel a more capable and
interoperable nostr client. Gift-wrapped DMs brought its private messaging in
line with the broader ecosystem, applesauce v4 updated the internal engine that
drives the app, and the local-first data tools offered faster timelines and more
user-controlled storage. OpenSats' support enabled sustained work by hzrd149
across these areas, helping noStrudel continue its role as a transparent,
standards-aligned client built for users who want deeper insight and control
within the nostr network.

### Nostur

[Nostur] is an iOS and macOS client designed to make nostr feel familiar to
users coming from mainstream social apps while still preserving the protocol's
core principles of openness and user control. Over the past year, development
has focused on expanding media options, reducing onboarding friction, and
reinforcing decentralized relay usage. With [OpenSats'
support](/blog/nostr-grants-october-2023), Fabian delivered a series of releases
that brought Nostur closer to a full-featured, privacy-respecting social
experience on Apple platforms.

Notes received an upgrade with the introduction of voice messages—short [audio
notes called Yaks]. This addition closes a usability gap between nostr clients
and mainstream messengers, allowing users to post quick recordings without
switching apps. Because voice messages operate fully within the nostr ecosystem,
they bring this convenience without relying on external communication channels.

Media handling improved as well with the implementation of [picture-first
posting], powered in part by Olas's photo-focused approach, along with native
Blossom media uploads. Users can now publish posts where the image comes first,
[browse visually rich content], and [store media] on decentralized Blossom
servers rather than centralized services. This shift strengthens durability and
user ownership: creators can serve their media from multiple backend locations,
mirror it automatically, and rely on open standards instead of third-party
silos.

Nostur also made it easier for users to build meaningful feeds with the
introduction of [one-tap conversion] of Lists into live feeds, letting users
turn any curated set of accounts into a timeline without extra configuration.
Follow Packs, added shortly after, help new users find active and relevant
accounts immediately. Later releases expanded relay management by integrating
outbox-style publishing and relay preview tools, reducing the need for manual
list editing and aligning Nostur with the broader shift toward decentralized
relay usage.

Throughout the year, Fabian emphasized resilience, simplicity, and
decentralization. Nostur's web-of-trust filters helped mitigate several waves of
spam attacks without central moderation, demonstrating that open networks can
defend themselves without restricting who can publish. Nostur was also one of
the first iOS and macOS clients to adopt Relay Autopilot (expands a user's relay
set based on who they follow), extending outbox-style automation to Apple
platforms and reducing reliance on a handful of large relays. Additional
features like live streams and support for using a WordPress site as a personal
media backend further expand what users can do while keeping data under their
control.

Within the Apple ecosystem, Nostur is steadily becoming a more capable,
privacy-oriented client that remains simple to use. Yaks give users an
alternative way to post messages, decentralized media uploads give creators more
control, and feed and outbox improvements make it easier for users to find and
follow meaningful content. OpenSats' support made it possible for Nostur to
expand its feature set while staying aligned with nostr's principle of
user-driven networks.

### Zap.stream

[Zap.stream] is a nostr-native live-streaming client with Lightning zap
capabilities that lets creators broadcast directly over the protocol while
keeping control of their identity and earnings. Over the past year, OpenSats has
[supported](/blog/kieran-receives-lts-grant) work by developer [Kieran] that
helped the project expand from a desktop-focused tool into a full mobile
experience, strengthen its streaming infrastructure, and introduce a
production-ready media backend that other nostr applications can build on.

A major shift came from bringing live streaming to mobile devices. The [Flutter]
apps for iOS and Android, developed by Kieran, now let creators go live directly
from their phone camera, receive notifications, open streams through links, and
connect their Lightning wallet through Nostr Wallet Connect. Streaming on nostr
is now accessible to everyday users rather than limited to desktop setups or
custom RTMP software. These changes began with the [v1.1.0] release in May 2025
and continued through subsequent updates that improved zap handling and polished
the viewing and broadcasting experience. The result is a mobile app that makes
it easy to start streaming and earning sats without giving up keys or relying on
custodial platforms.

Zap.stream's backend became more flexible through the development of their core
streaming server, a Rust-based engine maintained by Kieran that handles live
video. It ingests RTMP live video streams, converts them into standard or
low-latency HLS formats used by video players, records broadcasts, and exposes
real-time metrics for operators. Because the engine is self-hostable and
supports horizontal scaling, anyone can run their own streaming backend that
works with the zap.stream interface. This moves nostr live streaming away from a
single service and toward a distributed marketplace of independent providers,
closer to the network's broader goal of minimizing single points of failure.

The project also introduced [Route96], a nostr-integrated media backend designed
for large video files, clips, and replayable content. Deployed at
[nostr.download], Route96 supports both [NIP-96] and Blossom, optimizing media
with thumbnails and compression, mirroring uploads across servers, honoring
Lightning-based storage limits, and serving files efficiently to video clients.
For applications like zap.stream, this provides durable, decentralized storage
without relying on legacy cloud infrastructure. For the wider ecosystem, it
offers a ready-to-use media backbone that any nostr client can integrate with,
enabling richer features such as VOD, clips, and image hosting without each
project needing to build its own storage stack.

As a result of this work, zap.stream has become a nostr live-streaming client
that pairs an easy mobile experience with self-hostable, interchangeable backend
infrastructure. The mobile apps made streaming accessible to more creators, the
Rust engine made backend infrastructure deployable by anyone, and Route96
provided a reliable way to store and deliver large media files. OpenSats'
support allowed Kieran to continue development across these areas, helping
zap.stream demonstrate what a user-controlled, open-protocol approach to live
streaming can look like.

The progress highlighted in this report shows nostr clients moving from early
experiments into dependable tools for a growing user base. Outbox models are
improving nostr's decentralization by having clients read from the relays people
actually publish to instead of defaulting to a handful of large relays. Better
key handling and external signers are reducing the risk of account loss.
Local-first data stacks, media backends, and notification systems are giving
users more control over how and where their data lives. Together, these projects
are turning the promise of portable identity and censorship-resistant
communication into tangible applications that people use every day.

OpenSats supports this work so that the foundations of nostr remain free, open,
and user-controlled. Grants give developers time to solve problems like sync
reliability, spam resistance, and onboarding flows, and to release features like
zaps, live streaming, and interoperable DMs in public code that anyone can
inspect, reuse, and build upon. The developers behind these clients are not just
building individual apps; they are defining how the nostr protocol feels in
practice and proving that users do not have to trade sovereignty for
convenience.

Nostr is still young, and there is plenty left to do—from better discovery and
safety tools to more resilient relay infrastructure and richer application
types. With thoughtful funding and continued collaboration, client developers
can keep pushing nostr toward a future where people everywhere can speak,
coordinate, and move value without asking for permission.

If you believe in building and maintaining censorship-resistant communication
infrastructure, consider supporting [The Nostr Fund](/funds/nostr). Every donation directly
helps independent developers ship open-source software that keeps users in
control.
