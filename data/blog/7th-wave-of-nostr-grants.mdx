We are pleased to announce our seventh round of nostr grants, supporting a new
group of projects that contribute to the growth and innovation happening in this
ecosystem. Nostr is evolving, with projects expanding their focus from pure
social networking to secure messaging and payments, IoT integrations, trusted
software distribution, and more.

The five projects of this funding wave are:

- [Nostr Arduino](#nostr-arduino)
- [White Noise](#white-noise)
- [futr](#futr)
- [Notedeck](#notedeck)
- [Keystache](#keystache)

With the continued support of the nostr community, we anticipate that these
projects will play a significant role in creating a more connected, open, and
resilient digital landscape.

Our goal is to contribute to the development of a more open and decentralized
internet that promotes creativity and collaboration. We remain committed to
supporting the developers behind these initiatives.

Our support for nostr is made possible by the generosity of our donors. If you
would like to help us continue supporting the nostr ecosystem, consider making a
donation to [The Nostr Fund](/funds/nostr):

Let's dive in and take a closer look at each project and how they align with [our
mission](/mission).

### Nostr Arduino

Nostr Arduino is an open-source library that integrates the nostr protocol with
[Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Introduction) microcontrollers,
enabling embedded devices to send and receive nostr events. Led by [Black
Coffee](https://github.com/blackcoffeexbt/), the project aims to provide
Internet of Things (IoT) devices with a permissionless, distributed network
without relying on centralized services or exposing them to spyware. Plans
include refactoring the library for better memory stability, increasing test
coverage, enhancing documentation, creating example projects, and promoting the
library through media content. The team also intends to collaborate on IoT NIP
use cases, make the hardware [NIP-46] remote signer production-ready, add NIP-46
support to web clients, enable remote device configuration via nostr, and
explore eCash integration.

### White Noise

JeffG is developing [White Noise](https://github.com/erskingardner/whitenoise),
a nostr-based messaging client focused on secure communication. It implements
double ratchet encryption for direct messages, supports group messaging, and
synchronizes conversations across multiple devices. Built on nostr's
censorship-resistant backbone, White Noise aims to deliver a seamless user
experience similar to Signal, but with the added benefits of open protocols and
decentralized infrastructure, ensuring privacy and accessibility for users in
the freedom tech space.

### futr

Futr is a decentralized nostr client written in Haskell, focusing on public and
private groups ([NIP-29]) and private direct messages ([NIP-17]). The project
positions itself more like Telegram than Twitter. It's a native app that doesn't
rely on a browser engine and is designed to cross-compile to Linux, Windows,
macOS, Android, and iOS. Plans include refactoring for better performance,
improving the user interface (possibly switching to Qt), implementing group and
private messaging, and integrating features like voice/video calls and Lightning
Network zaps with the aim of improving security and further decentralizing communications.

### Notedeck

Notedeck is a multi-platform nostr client for Android and desktop, inspired by
TweetDeck. It offers a fully modular dashboard with customizable columns,
enabling users to manage multiple accounts simultaneously. Users can view
different timelines, notifications, direct messages, and bookmarks from a
unified interface, rearranging columns as desired. The mobile version provides a
similar experience optimized for single-column viewing. Future development
includes account management, improved UI navigation, modular column support,
posting capabilities, and profile viewing.

### Keystache

Keystache is a desktop-native nostr signing application that offers a seamless
single-sign-on experience and key management for desktop users. Similar to the
Alby Chrome Extension but tailored for desktop environments, it provides a base
layer for nostr desktop apps, eliminating the need for individual apps to manage
private keys. 
Currently in alpha for [Apple
Silicon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_silicon) and supporting [NIP-55]
for key management, Keystache aims to reach beta soon and version 1.0 by year's
end. Plans include evolving into a portal for nostr with features like an app
marketplace, Fedimint wallet integration, signing permissions, and local relay
support, simplifying key management, and fostering nostr desktop application
development.
