OpenSats is thrilled to announce long-term support for William Casarin, aka
[jb55](https://github.com/jb55).

Will’s prolific contributions to the Nostr ecosystem, highlighted by his
development of Damus, have advanced Bitcoin integration into social networking
through pioneering "Zaps," peer-to-peer micropayments between users over the
Lightning Network.

With this grant, Will plans to further enhance the Nostr ecosystem through the
following projects:

- [NostrDB](https://github.com/damus-io/nostrdb): LMDB-backed database with zero-copy, `O(1)` access to note fields for embeddable Nostr query support.
- [Upgrading Damus iOS](https://github.com/damus-io/damus): Continuing development, code reviews, and integration of NostrDB.
- [Notedeck](https://github.com/damus-io/notedeck): Multiplatform Nostr client for Android and desktops, with customizable features and a reproducible build environment.
- [Notecrumbs](https://github.com/damus-io/notecrumbs): A Nostr OpenGraph server designed to quickly render notes and cache images.

> I am deeply committed to the advancement of Bitcoin by integrating it into
> Nostr, ensuring that freedom of speech and financial sovereignty are accessible
> to all.
