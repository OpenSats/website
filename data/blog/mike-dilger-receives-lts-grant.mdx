OpenSats is excited to announce long-term support for Mike Dilger, a dedicated
contributor in the nostr ecosystem.

Mike is known for being the lead developer of
[Gossip](https://github.com/mikedilger/gossip?tab=readme-ov-file#), a nostr
client designed to prioritize privacy and security by avoiding [common web stack
vulnerabilities](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/#) and leveraging rust
language security.

Gossip has become a reference implementation for the "[outbox
model](https://mikedilger.com/gossip-model/)," a design that enables more
scalable message distribution across the nostr network. In addition to Gossip,
Mike is known for his contributions to several tools and libraries that support the nostr
ecosystem, such as the [chorus relay](https://github.com/mikedilger/chorus) and
[relay tester](https://github.com/mikedilger/relay-tester), as well as his active
[participation in NIP
discussions](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/issues?q=involves%3Amikedilger).

With the support of this LTS grant, Mike plans to continue his work on the
Gossip client, focusing on:

- Improving support for replying to various versions of replaceable events.

- Adding [NIP-96](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/96.md) file
  uploads.

- Implementing Blossom support, Web of Trust, and search functionality at the relay level.

- Enhancing reporting and labeling capabilities
  ([NIP-56](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/56.md)/[NIP-32](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/32.md))

> Never in my life has something so important fallen into my lap, and I feel
