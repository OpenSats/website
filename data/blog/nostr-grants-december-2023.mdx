summary: "OpenSats is funding seven more open-source projects in the nostr ecosystem."

It’s been a year of notes, a year of zaps, a year of purple-feathered early
adopters telling each other “good morning” and “good night”; a year of
experimentation, a year of relaying, and a year of building other stuff.

While still in its infancy, nostr is slowly but surely establishing itself as
something that stands out from the flock of decentralized social media
protocols. As more and more people realize its elegant simplicity—and the power
that direct lightning integration brings—nostr will inevitably grow and mature.

No technology is ever fully formed or perfect, and neither is nostr. However, we
believe it has the right building blocks and solid architecture, which is what
will allow it to go beyond what we currently understand and know as the social
web.

In addition to the 32 nostr grants announced [in the past](/tags/nostr), we are
giving out 7 more grants to the following nostr projects:

- [Lume](#lume)
- [Flockstr](#flockstr)
- [Camelus](#camelus)
- [noStrudel](#nostrudel)
- [ZapThreads](#zapthreads)
- [NIP-44 Cryptography Audit](#nip-44-cryptography-audit)
- [NIP-90 Data Vending Machine Framework](#nip-90-data-vending-machine-framework)

This brings the total number of nostr grants to 39, providing support for a wide
range of developers working on clients, relays, libraries, NIPs, cryptography,
research, education, [design](https://nostrdesign.org/), UX, and ... other stuff.

Our nostr grants are sourced from [The Nostr Fund](/projects/nostr). If you

As always, let's look at each project in more detail:

### Lume

[Lume](https://lume.nu/) is a cross-platform nostr desktop client focused on
creating a unique communication and content browsing experience. Lume aims to be
extendable and customizable, allowing users to easily install extensions and use
various themes. Its multi-column TweetDeck-style interface is a great way to
stay on top of multiple feeds and topics at once.

### Flockstr

[Flockstr](https://www.flockstr.com/) is a calendar events app on nostr. Users
are able to create events, post updates, invite other users, issue tickets,
collect payments, and pretty much everything that is commonplace on centralized
platforms like Eventbrite and Meetups.com. The goal is to provide a seamless UI
so users foreign to nostr may be entirely unaware that they are using a
decentralized ecosystem aside from when signing in or seamlessly paying for paid
events via lightning.

### Camelus

[Camelus](https://camelus.app/) is an Android client that focuses on ease-of-use
and content delivery. One design choice is to remove addicting features such as
likes, pull to refresh, and other dark patterns that are designed to keep you
addicted. The goal is to have users come back to the app because of content
rather than dark patterns.

While the client is currently focused on short kind:1 notes, support for
long-form content and communities is to be added in future versions. Camelus is
built upon [NDK](https://github.com/nostr-dev-kit/) and the
[NIP-65](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/65.md) gossip model,
allowing the client to focus on higher-level functionality and features.

### noStrudel

[noStrudel](https://camelus.app/) is a fast and feature-rich web client that is
focused on power users and developers. While it is not geared towards complete
newcomers, it might help curious users learn more about how nostr works under
the hood.

It supports quite a bit of other stuff, offering e.g. strong support for
communities with a Reddit-style interface for
[NIP-72](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/72.md) moderated
content. Alongside regular note, messaging, and profile functionality, noStrudel
also features streams, channels, lists, badges, and more.

### ZapThreads

[ZapThreads](https://zapthreads.dev/) is a standalone component that provides
threaded comments for nostr clients. It allows a commenting experience on any
nostr event, including long-form notes. ZapThreads is currently integrated into
Habla.news, nostr.cooking, 21ideas.org, and other nostr apps.

Commenting on generic URLs is also supported, allowing it to become the
commenting system of any web page. The focus of ZapThreads is to keep the
component versatile, fast, lightweight, and extremely easy to integrate.

### NIP-44 Cryptography Audit

While nostr allows for encrypted direct messages to be sent, the current
[NIP-04](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/04.md) standard has
[significant
flaws](https://habla.news/u/hodlbod@coracle.social/0gmn3DDizCIesG-PCD-JK) that
[NIP-44](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/44.md) aims to
address. A new encryption standard would allow us to fix DMs, implement group
chats, and facilitate other encrypted use cases within nostr. Cryptography is
hard, however, which is why NIP-44 underwent an independent audit covered by
this grant.

The result of the audit is [available as a
PDF](https://cure53.de/audit-report_nip44-implementations.pdf) and the issues
found will be addressed in the coming weeks.

### NIP-90 Data Vending Machine Framework

This generic framework provides an easy way to build and run
[NIP-90](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/90.md) DVMs. While
notes and zaps are fun and all, there is a lot of “other stuff” that can be done
with nostr. Data Vending Machines (DVMs) are a way to perform a variety of
automated tasks over nostr, i.e. get something (computationally expensive) done
in exchange for sats.

Some algorithms might provide content curation or profile recommendations, while
others might use LLMs to generate or transform content on the fly. Thanks to
NIP-90, nostr can act as a marketplace for data processing, where users can
request jobs to be processed without having to care about "who" processes the
data.
