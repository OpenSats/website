We are thrilled to announce that OpenSats has received an additional donation of
\$21M from [#startsmall](https://startsmall.llc/), Jack Dorsey's philanthropic
initiative. This donation will top up our funds and operations budget, with
\$15,000,000 going to our [General Fund][gf], \$5,000,000 to [The Nostr
Fund][nf], and \$1M to our [operations budget][ops].

We agree, and are honored and humbled to receive such a generous donation. We
will do our best to continually allocate the funds to high-impact projects and
[freedom tech infrastructure](/blog/bitcoin-infrastructure-this-decade).  As of
this writing, OpenSats has allocated close to [\$10,000,000 in grants][EOY2023],
supporting over 100 grantees, many of whom for the [long term](/tags/lts).

As a 501(c)(3) public charity, we rely on donations from the general public,
including philanthropic organizations such as [#startsmall](https://startsmall.llc/)  and the [Reynolds
Foundation](/blog/opensats-receives-one-million-from-reynolds-foundation).
We are incredibly grateful for the massive support we have received in the last
18 months, and we hope that other philanthropists will join in so that OpenSats
may remain an effective public charity for many years to come.

If you are aligned with [our mission](/mission) and are
supporting Bitcoin and the broader freedom tech movement in general, don't
hesitate to [reach out to us](/contact) or donate to one of
[our funds](/funds). Every sat counts, and every little bit
helps.

Thank you for your continued support. Free and open-source software is a
collaborative effort, and we couldn't do it without all of you. Let us proceed
together, optimistically and apace.

Onward.
