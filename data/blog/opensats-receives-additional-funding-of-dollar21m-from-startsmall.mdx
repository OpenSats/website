We are thrilled to announce that OpenSats has received an additional donation of
\$21M from [#startsmall](https://startsmall.llc/), Jack Dorsey's philanthropic
initiative. This donation will top up our funds as well as our operations
budget, with \$15,000,000 going to our [General Fund][gf], \$5,000,000 to [The Nostr
Fund][nf], and \$1M to our [operations budget][ops].

We agree, and are honored and humbled to receive such a generous donation. We
will do our best to [continually allocate][EOY2023] the funds to high-impact
projects and [freedom tech
infrastructure](/blog/bitcoin-infrastructure-this-decade),
on top of providing long-term support for exceptional open-source developers and
researchers.

As a 501(c)(3) public charity  we are reliant on donations from the general
public, as well as philanthropic organizations such as #startsmall and the
[Reynolds
Foundation](/blog/opensats-receives-one-million-from-reynolds-foundation).
We are incredibly grateful for the massive support we have received in the last
18 months, and we hope that other philanthropists will join in so that OpenSats
may remain an effective public charity for many years to come.

If you are aligned with [our mission](/mission) and are in
support of Bitcoin and the wider freedom tech movement in general, don't
hesitate to [reach out to us](mailto:donate@opensats.org) or make a donation to
one of [our funds](/funds). Every sat counts, and every
little bit helps.
