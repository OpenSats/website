As we enter the 5th Bitcoin epoch, OpenSats is proud to announce our 5th wave of
Bitcoin grants. While Bitcoin continues its journey of increasingly embedding
itself into global institutional finance and public markets, we must not forget
that behind these notable milestones are hardworking, passionate individuals who
dedicate their time and energy to writing and maintaining free and open-source
Bitcoin software.

Our goal is to provide sustainable funding for FOSS contributors, especially
those who make Bitcoin flourish. Over the last couple of weeks, our board has
selected ten more projects for funding.

In alphabetical order, they are:

- [Core Lightning Bookkeeper Dashboard](#core-lightning-bookkeeper-dashboard)
- [Cove](#cove)
- [Fedimint On-Chain Wallet](#fedimint-on-chain-wallet)
- [Krux](#krux)
- [Krux Installer](#krux-installer)
- [Lightning Network Protocol Test Framework](#lightning-network-protocol-test-framework)
- [Macadamia](#macadamia)
- [Tor Support for BDK \& Fedimint](#tor-support-for-bdk--fedimint)
- [Utreexo](#utreexo)
- [Validating Lightning Signer](#validating-lightning-signer)

These grants are sourced from our [General Fund](/projects/general_fund), which
is funded by generous donors like you. If you would like to support free and
open-source projects that help Bitcoin flourish, consider donating to the fund:

We are incredibly grateful for all donations—large and small—and are happy to
have received significant donations from [The Reynolds
Foundation](/blog/opensats-receives-one-million-from-reynolds-foundation) and
[#startsmall](/blog/opensats-receives-additional-funding-of-dollar21m-from-startsmall)
recently, which helped enable these grants.

Without further ado, let us take a closer look at the projects to understand
what they are about and how they align with [our mission](/mission):

### Core Lightning Bookkeeper Dashboard

The _Core Lightning Bookkeeper Dashboard_ provides a Graphical User Interface to
the Core Lightning (CLN) back-end. Core Lightning is one of the four major
Lightning implementations alongside [Eclair](https://github.com/ACINQ/eclair),
Lightning Development Kit ([LDK](https://github.com/lightningdevkit)), and
Lightning Network Daemon ([LND](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd)).

The dashboard is inspired by [Umbrel’s Lightning
app](https://github.com/getumbrel/umbrel-lightning), which in turn was built
upon work done by Casa for their [Lightning
node](https://github.com/Casa/Casa-Node-API) implementation. This is the power
of FOSS on full display: being able to build upon previous work to the benefit
of all.

This grant is to support the addition of three new visual elements to the
bookkeeper:

- A balance sheet tracker to show the current and historical balance of sats on the node each day.
- The "sats flow" to show the changes in debits and credits over time
- A volume chord schematic to show the flow of sats routed between nodes.

In combination, these features will improve accessibility to the underlying data
CLN already captures.

### Cove

Cove is a new single-sig mobile wallet optimized for use with hardware signing
devices. Cove leverages BDK with the core of the app built in Rust and an
interface built with SwiftUI (for iOS) and Jetpack Compose (for Android). The
design objective is to make this a first choice for new bitcoiners, making it
easy as they move to hardware signing devices—and subsequently to watch-only
wallets.

This grant will enable the build of the core wallet along with support for
Partially Signed Bitcoin Transactions
([PSBTs](https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/psbt/)) via Near Field Communications
([NFC](https://squareup.com/au/en/the-bottom-line/managing-your-finances/nfc)),
Quick Response codes ([QR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code)), and virtual
drives for offline signing. In the future, Cove will support coin control,
passphrase use, multiple accounts, decoy wallets, and connecting to your own
node.

### Fedimint On-Chain Wallet

[Fedimint](https://fedimint.org/) is an open-source federated Chaumian eCash
mint project used by several eCash projects, including Fedi and Mutiny Wallet.
Chaumian eCash provides significant privacy benefits to mint users, and at its
core uses the groundbreaking work of cryptographer David Chaum from 1982.
Fedimints require no changes to either the Bitcoin base layer or the Lightning
protocol.

This grant supports work to improve the liquidity and efficiency of exiting from
mints via the on-chain wallet. Fedimint traditionally uses the Lightning Network
as the instant settlement and connectivity fabric between mints, but exiting
directly to Bitcoin's base layer was always part of Fedimint's design. Work on
the on-chain wallet will focus on optimizing these base-layer transactions under
load.

License: [MIT](https://github.com/fedimint/fedimint/blob/master/LICENSE)

### Krux

Krux is open-source firmware that enables anyone to build their own Bitcoin
signing device via off-the-shelf parts. It runs on Kendryte K210 devices such as
the Maix Amigo or the M5StickV (among others), converting them into air-gapped
devices that can sign transactions for multisignature and single-signature
wallets.

This grant supports the effort to expand firmware functionality and the range of
supported devices, including PCs and Android mobile devices. New features will
include the introduction of Krux Apps to enable games, additional OpSec
features, and the ability to use the signing device for Nostr.

Repository: [selfcustody/krux](https://github.com/selfcustody/krux)  
License: Apache2 & [MIT](https://github.com/selfcustody/krux/blob/main/LICENSE.md)

### Krux Installer

Whilst Krux is an open-source firmware that allows anyone to build their own
signing device for Bitcoin transactions, `krux-installer` is the desktop
application that allows anyone to install the Krux firmware in a safe, easy, and
transparent way.  This makes the use of Krux more accessible and consequently
helps adoption and use; GrapheneOS’s deployment of a web-based installer for
their OS onto hardware similarly saw upticks in adoption and use for the same
reason.

This grant will enable the project to refactor and align the technology between
`krux` and the `krux-installer`, improving supportability and reducing technical
footprint. Additionally, this grant will allow developers to focus on macOS
deployment and implement a "Wipe the device" feature to enhance security.

### Lightning Network Protocol Test Framework

The Lightning Network protocol test framework provides a common and reusable
framework for easier testing of proposed protocol changes. This framework allows
developers to test the impact on other implementations as part of the
verification and validation process. It is part of the aptly named [Lightning
Network Interoperability
Initiative](https://lnspec-tools.github.io/ln-interoperability-initiative/index.html),
which—you guessed it—aims to improve the interoperability between various
Lightning Network implementations.

This grant will be used to turn the test framework into a library, making re-use
by each group working on the Lightning Network simpler, and can be used to build
and expand a base set of tests that are shared. In this way, each group can
contribute to a common  test pool for the protocol, including those who have
implementation-specific features (such as Pool or AMP).

### Macadamia

[Macadamia](https://macadamia.cash/) is a native iOS wallet written in Swift and
SwiftUI for the [Cashu](https://cashu.space/) Chaumian eCash protocol. The
wallet aims to make privacy-preserving eCash use simple, smooth, and stable.
Macadamia includes the ability to send eCash on [Nostr](https://nostr.com/). It
is currently in early-stage beta and is available on Testflight.

This grant supports the separation of wallet and Cashu logic, separating the
latter into a stand-alone Swift library with support for mandatory
[NUTS](https://nips.nostr.com/), and (initially) NUT-07, NUT-09, and NUT-13.

Additional support for more complex Cashu capabilities and better support for
mints—including multi-mint multi-path payments—is on the roadmap for future
releases.

### Tor Support for BDK & Fedimint

The [Bitcoin Development Kit](https://bitcoindevkit.org/) (BDK) provides a
library of Bitcoin wallet capabilities for developers to build cross-platform
Bitcoin wallets without needing to worry about Bitcoin internals.
[Fedimint](https://fedimint.org/) is an open-source Chaumian eCash framework
project that leverages BDK, and like  BDK  is also written in Rust. Fedimint
should not be conflated with any commercial efforts building on top of the
open-source protocol, such as [Fedi](https://www.fedi.xyz/).

This grant effort will focus on delivering Tor support for Fedimint clients and
adding new gateways and PayJoin support. For BDK, this grant effort is focused
on Tor support for the
[`rust-esplora-client`](https://github.com/bitcoindevkit/rust-esplora-client),
upgrading `rust-bitcoin`, and building support for pruned nodes.

Both  Fedimint and BDK are increasingly being leveraged by other projects in the
wider Bitcoin ecosystem, such as BitKey, Mutiny Wallet, and LDK. Consequently,
it is important that these building blocks provide a strong level of privacy and
security.

Licenses: [MIT](https://github.com/bitcoindevkit/bdk/blob/master/LICENSE-MIT)/[Apache2](https://github.com/bitcoindevkit/bdk/blob/master/LICENSE-APACHE) & [MIT](https://github.com/fedimint/fedimint/blob/master/LICENSE)

### Utreexo

Utreexo utilizes Merkle trees to provide an alternate structure for access to
Bitcoin data, enabling compact state nodes, parallelization of the Initial Block
Download (IBD), and thereby wider distribution of functional Bitcoin nodes. This
opens the door to browser-based and smaller low-power devices to become Bitcoin
nodes—including mobile devices!

This grant supports the activities to complete the P2P tx messaging
implementation, write up the four BIPs required for `utreexo`, and commence
building the bridge node implementation within Bitcoin Core. Subsequent work on
optimizing performance for IBD, increasing efficiency in the accumulator
implementation, and improving library support are to follow.

License: [MIT](https://github.com/utreexo/utreexo/blob/master/LICENSE.md)

### Validating Lightning Signer

Validating Lightning Signer (VLS) is an open-source project with the explicit
goal to improve the security of the Lightning Network, by separating "hot"
bitcoin keys from operational Lightning nodes. VLS works by storing private keys
in a specialized signing device which adds an additional layer of security.
Especially for businesses and enterprises this additional security provides
important safeguards currently not accessible.

This grant supports the work for VLS focused on support for low-resource
signers, tuning for embedded processors, fine-tuning for latency and memory use,
and dockerization. Subsequent focus then moves to operation on hardened servers,
and validated support for high volume lightning use, i.e. thousands of channels
and millions of payments. Future work extends support to LND beyond the initial
[Core Lightning](https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning) and
[LDK](https://github.com/lightningdevkit)  implementations,  and then to support
for Splicing and multi-sig lightning key management.
