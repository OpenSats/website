After announcing our first wave of grants for bitcoin[^fn-btc] and nostr[^fn-nostr] projects, we are
pleased to announce an additional wave of grants for open-source projects in the
space:

[^fn-btc]: [First Wave of Bitcoin Grants](https://opensats.org/blog/bitcoin-grants-july-2023)
[^fn-nostr]: [First Wave of Nostr Grants](https://opensats.org/blog/nostr-grants-july-2023)

- [BDK](#bdk)
- [LNbits](#lnbits)
- [Watchdescriptor](#watchdescriptor)
- [Stratum V2 Testing \& Benchmarking Tool](#stratum-v2-testing--benchmarking-tool)
- [Fedimint Modules and Resources](#fedimint-modules-and-resources)
- [Amber: Nostr Event Signer](#amber-nostr-event-signer)
- [Nostr UI/UX Development](#nostr-uiux-development)
- [Nostr Use-Case Exploration \& Education](#nostr-use-case-exploration--education)

The first five grants are sourced from our [General Fund][bitcoin-fund], the
last three—being nostr projects—from our [Nostr Fund][nostr-fund]. This brings
the total number of OpenSats grants to 41, adding to the grants we previously
announced in July.

Once again, let's take a closer look at each of the projects to see how they
align with the [OpenSats mission][mission].

### BDK

Bitcoin Development Kit (BDK) is a set of libraries and tools that allows you to
seamlessly build cross-platform on-chain bitcoin wallets without having to
re-implement standard bitcoin data structures, algorithms, and protocols. BDK is
built on top of the powerful rust-bitcoin and rust-miniscript libraries and adds
features for managing descriptor-based wallets, syncing wallets to the bitcoin
blockchain, viewing transaction histories, managing and selecting UTXOs to
create new transactions, signing, and more. The core BDK components are written
in Rust, but the team also maintains Kotlin and Swift language bindings for use
in mobile projects. There are also Python bindings, and React Native and Flutter
support is being actively developed.

### LNbits

LNbits is used by a multitude of projects in the bitcoin space, especially as
part of their lightning payments stack. Being easy to build on through its
extension framework, LNbits has been pioneering various cutting-edge solutions
and experiments in the world of bitcoin, lightning, and nostr.

The project has a thriving maker community building various hardware devices
such as Lightning ATMs, point-of-sale devices, DIY hardware wallets, and nostr
signing devices. The modular design of LNbits makes it attractive to users and
tinkerers alike, as its plugin architecture makes it easy to extend and
understand.

### Watchdescriptor

`watchdescriptor` is a CLN plugin written in Rust that connects a business's
treasury wallet to its CLN node. It utilizes
[`cln-plugin`](https://docs.rs/cln-plugin/latest/cln_plugin/) and the BDK
library to track coin movements in registered wallets and report this
information to the `bookkeeper` plugin.

The plugin enables businesses to design a complete treasury using
[Miniscript](https://bitcoin.sipa.be/miniscript/) and import the resulting
descriptor into CLN. Since `bookkeeper` already accounts for all coin movements
internal to CLN, this plugin is the last piece businesses need in order to unify
all their bitcoin accounting in one place. This enables businesses to account
for all inflows and outflows from their operations, streamlining tax reporting
and financial analysis.

The `watchdescriptor` project is part of a broader vision to transform the
lightning node (particularly CLN) into a financial hub for businesses, enabling
them to conduct operations without reliance on any third parties.

### Stratum V2 Testing & Benchmarking Tool

The Stratum V2 Testing & Benchmarking Tool allows the bitcoin mining industry to
test and benchmark Stratum V2 performance against Stratum V1. The tool supports
different mining scenarios to help miners make informed decisions and evaluate
their profitability. The goal of the project is to motivate miners to upgrade to
Stratum V2, increasing their individual profits and making the Bitcoin network
more resilient in the process.

### Fedimint Modules and Resources

Fedimint is a federated Chaumian e-cash mint backed by sats with deposits and
withdrawals that can occur on-chain or via lightning. It can be understood as a
scaling and privacy layer as well as an adoption accelerator for Bitcoin.

The goal of this particular project is to improve the Fedimint UI and develop
free and open resources for developers and "Guardians" to enable more people to
run and develop on Fedimint.

### Amber: Nostr Event Signer

Amber is a nostr event signer for Android. It allows users to keep their `nsec`
segregated in a single, dedicated app. The goal of Amber is to have your
smartphone act as a
[NIP-46](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/46.md) signing
device without any need for servers or additional hardware. "Private keys should
be exposed to as few systems as possible as each system adds to the attack
surface," as the rationale of said NIP states. In addition to native apps, Amber
aims to support all current nostr web applications without requiring any
extensions or web servers.

### Nostr UI/UX Development

The goal of this project is to help improve the UI/UX of major nostr clients,
starting with
[Gossip](https://www.figma.com/file/JJQwKYImD2lyzWR81fxo7w/Nostr?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design)
and Coracle, emphasizing the onboarding process as well as usability and
accessibility. One part of onboarding is solving the discoverability problem
that nostr has in the first place. Solving the problem of jumping in and out of
the nostr world is what motivated the development of
[`njump`](https://github.com/fiatjaf/njump), which was redesigned as part of
these efforts and is now live at
[njump.me](https://njump.me/npub10pensatlcfwktnvjjw2dtem38n6rvw8g6fv73h84cuacxn4c28eqyfn34f).

In addition to client-specific improvements, generic design modules and
learnings will be incorporated into the [Nostr
Design](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1r75wMCSBteQjXKGXELrNdu3wwns5fsgMPwSBIQY1sPU/edit#heading=h.k4vues73209h)
project for others to use.

### Nostr Use-Case Exploration & Education

As of today, most nostr clients implement social media applications on top of
the nostr protocol. However, nostr allows for various use cases, many of which
go beyond social media. Two examples are [Listr](https://listr.lol/) and
[Ostrich](https://ostrich.work/), a list management tool and job board,
respectively.

In addition to use-case exploration, this project will continue to educate users
and developers alike, be it via [Nostr How](https://nostr.how/) or various video
series, e.g., explaining how to build upon
[NDK](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWCXpceoxeCKDo73t6VmtbfE_RjSRxs9p).
