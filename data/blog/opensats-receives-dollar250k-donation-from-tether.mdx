We are pleased to announce that [Tether](https://tether.io/), the largest
company in the digital assets industry, has made a $250,000 donation to
OpenSats. This contribution strengthens our ability to fund free and open-source
projects that secure Bitcoin and advance the broader freedom tech ecosystem.

As a 501(c)(3) public charity, OpenSats directs 100% of donations to our
[General Fund](/funds/general) and [The Nostr Fund](/funds/nostr) to open-source
projects and builders, while separate contributions to our [Operations
Budget](/funds/ops) cover our administrative and operational expenses.

Support from organizations like Tether helps us sustain our grant giving model
and allows us to continue sending bitcoin directly to developers, researchers,
educators, and maintainers working on critical infrastructure.

>We at Tether believe that Bitcoin, and the free, open-source software that
>powers it, are indispensable to a freer and decentralized future. OpenSats is
>on the front line supporting the continued growth of this ecosystem by funding
>the next generation of innovators, and we are proud to support their work.

><cite>—Paolo Ardoino, CEO of Tether</cite>

Tether has emphasized its commitment to Bitcoin, free and open-source
development, and funding public goods that support financial freedom. This
donation is part of that broader effort to back tools and infrastructure that
expand access to open, censorship-resistant technology.

>OpenSats has provided [over 300 grants](/transparency) to developers working on
>freedom tech projects. Support from Tether will help us continue to scale our
>mission globally.
