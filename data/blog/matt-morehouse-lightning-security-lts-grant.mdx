We are excited to announce that Matt Morehouse is receiving long-term support
from OpenSats. Matt is a security researcher & developer focused on the
detection and prevention of various bugs and attack vectors that could threaten
the stability of the Lightning Network.

He is dedicated to enhancing the security and robustness of Lightning
implementations through extensive fuzz testing, meticulous [auditing of BOLT
specs](https://github.com/lightning/bolts/pulls?q=is%3Apr+reviewed-by%3Amorehouse+sort%3Aupdated-desc)
and Lightning implementations, and responsible disclosure of discovered bugs and
vulnerabilities. His efforts aim to motivate greater investment in the security
of Lightning, ensuring its reliability and trustworthiness.

His past contributions include:

- Responsible disclosure of the ["fake channel" DoS vector](https://morehouse.github.io/lightning/fake-channel-dos/).
- Discovery of a [griefing attack](https://github.com/lightning/bolts/pull/851#discussion_r997537630) in the interactive-tx protocol.
- Helped prevent a [BOLT2 change](https://github.com/lightning/bolts/pull/1083) that would allow the channel reserve to be violated.
- Overhauled [LND's](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/issues/7452) and [CLN's fuzzing infrastructure](https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning/issues/6083).
- Various bug fixes and fuzz tests for [CLN](https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning/commits?author=morehouse) and [LND](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/commits?author=morehouse).

In all likelihood, the Lightning Network will play a crucial role in any future
that has Bitcoin scaling to 10 billion users. However, since the beginning of
the network, the development of new features often had priority over the overall
security and robustness of the network. Adding new features like dual funded
channels, Taproot channels, splicing, and BOLT 12 is still the main priority for
most developers and users, but all these features introduce added complexity.
"Complexity is the worst enemy of security," to quote Bruce Schneier, "and our
systems are getting more complex all the time." Lightning is no exception.  Matt's
research and fuzz testing of Lightning implementations is an effort to
counteract this trend.

> If we're going to make Lightning even more complex, we also need to ramp up the
> engineering effort we put towards making the network secure and robust. Because
> in the end it doesn't matter how feature-rich and easy-to-use the Lightning
> Network is if it can't keep user funds safe.
