### Advancing Formal Verification for Bitcoin Cryptography

Advancing Formal Verification for Bitcoin Cryptography is a research effort by
developer [remix7531] on the cryptographic building blocks that secure Bitcoin
software. The project focuses on [RustCrypto's] `sha2` and `k256` crates and on
multi-scalar multiplication for the `secp256k1` curve, a key operation for batch
signature verification in Bitcoin. Remix7531 applies proof assistants and formal
methods to construct machine-checked proofs for critical cryptographic routines
and to connect them to Rust and C implementations.

This grant will support formal verification on these RustCrypto crates and on
multi-scalar multiplication for the `secp256k1` curve. The project will use the
[HAX toolchain] with [F*] to verify that the code does what it is supposed to do
and runs safely, ruling out panics, integer overflows, out-of-bounds errors, and
infinite loops. It will also develop precise specifications and proofs for
multi-scalar multiplication and will compare proof assistants for verifying
performance-critical C implementations. The resulting code, proofs, and
technical reports will be released under a free software license and will serve
as a blueprint for future formal verification of Bitcoin cryptographic
libraries.

### BitcoinerLAB and RewindBitcoin

[BitcoinerLAB] is a TypeScript toolkit by developer [Landabaso] for building
Bitcoin applications with descriptors and Miniscript. It provides modules for
address and transaction construction, signers and blockchain backends, and it
integrates with bitcoinjs-lib for use in existing JavaScript codebases.
Thousands of public repositories depend on BitcoinerLAB, including Ledger APIs,
Bitcoin Keeper, LN Markets, and RewindBitcoin.

[RewindBitcoin] is another project by Landabaso. It is a self-custody mobile
wallet for iOS and Android that applies vault-style spending controls. It uses
timelocks, pre-signed transactions, and an emergency spending path to protect
funds in situations of theft or coercion.

This grant will support BitcoinerLAB and RewindBitcoin. For BitcoinerLAB, work
will include Taproot Miniscript support in TypeScript, broader hardware wallet
integration through a general signer API, and a cleared backlog of features such
as MuSig-style multisig, CPFP, and RBF in the coin selector, plus new
documentation and use-case guides. Planned work on RewindBitcoin will explore
Pay-to-Anchor and TRUC-based rescue flows, add hardware wallet support on top of
that design, and improve coin control, labeling, fee management, and overall UX.
These projects aim to create stronger Miniscript foundations for TypeScript
developers and a practical vault wallet for people facing real risks of theft or
coercion of their Bitcoin.

### BTCaaron and Mastering Taproot

The btcaaron project is a lightweight Python toolkit by developer
[aaron-recompile] for Bitcoin Layer 1 development with a focus on Taproot. It
runs on testnet and supports Legacy, SegWit, and Taproot address types, UTXO
scanning, transaction construction, signing, and broadcasting for testnet flows.
It also exposes a Taproot-native API for building script trees, key-path and
script-path spends, and automatic witness construction for common spend paths.

Mastering Taproot is Aaron Zhang's open-access [developer guide to Taproot],
with full Python code samples, testnet transactions, and step-by-step stack
execution, published in English and Chinese as a reproducible online book. The
text uses clear examples, control block diagrams, and verifiable transaction IDs
so readers can inspect and replay every construction.

This grant will support btcaaron and Mastering Taproot. Planned work for
btcaaron includes a refactored core structure, new helpers for Taproot
script-path spending, PSBT v2 support, multi-leaf Taproot construction utilities
and visualization and simulation features for Taproot scripts, along with a 1.0
release for testnet and regtest workflows. Planned work for Mastering Taproot
includes finalizing the English manuscript, expanding runnable examples,
releasing Chinese translations of key chapters, and publishing tutorial videos,
walkthroughs, and workshop materials for Bitcoin scripting education. The goal
is a cohesive toolkit and curriculum that lowers the barrier for new Bitcoin
developers, especially in Chinese-speaking communities, and accelerates
practical Taproot experimentation.

### Cashu Dev Kit (CDK)

Although we have [supported the CDK project] in the past, this additional grant
supports developer [Asmo] for his work on CDK operability across cloud
environments. [Cashu Dev Kit] is the core Rust toolkit for operating Cashu mints
and services. It supports Postgres for storage, Prometheus for metrics, and
provides Docker images for common environments, including ARM64. Asmo triages
bugs, reviews pull requests, and adds features for operators and integrators.
His work includes the Prometheus exporter and Grafana dashboard, improvements to
Postgres and FFI support, and the Blink payment processor backend.

With this grant, Asmo will turn CDK into a cloud-native infrastructure for Cashu
mints. The roadmap expands Prometheus metrics to cover database and payment
activity and feeds them into Orchard dashboards for mint operators. He plans to
build a Cashu [Kubernetes Controller] that manages CDK mints and Orchard on
Kubernetes clusters and handles rolling upgrades, configuration secrets, health
probes, backups, and restores. Logging will move to structured JSON formats, and
configuration will be simplified and documented so deployments stay predictable
at different scales. Build pipelines will migrate to self-hosted GitHub runners,
and CDK will publish several image profiles for minimal, base, standalone, and
cloud deployments. In parallel, Asmo will prototype secure deployments on Amazon
Nitro Enclaves and extend gRPC-based payment backends such as
`cdk-blink-payment-processor` to support BOLT12, on-chain payments, and
additional providers including Stripe, Strike, and LNbits.

### Cashu TS and Coco

[Cashu TS] is a TypeScript library for building Cashu wallets and applications.
Maintained by returning grantee [Egge], lead developer of [npub.cash], `cashu-ts`
wraps the Cashu protocol and NUTs into a reusable wallet toolkit so developers
can connect to mints, mint and melt ecash, and manage tokens without
reimplementing low-level logic. The library is widely used in the Cashu
ecosystem and powers web, mobile, and backend integrations in projects ranging
from wallets to merchant tools.

Coco builds on `cashu-ts` and adds networking, storage, key management, and a
unified API so developers can embed a full Cashu wallet in browsers, Node.js,
and React Native with minimal connective code.

With this grant, Egge will keep `cashu-ts` aligned with new Cashu NUTs and
protocol changes and complete its ongoing API migration while maintaining
stability for existing dependents. He plans to refine documentation and examples
so application teams can adopt new features without friction. He will also push
Coco toward its first stable release and add missing protocol features such as
automatic key handling for locked and BOLT12 mint quotes, tools for managing
balances across multiple mints, multi-nut payments that combine funds from
several mints for one invoice, and payment request flows with nostr integration.
The goal is a pair of libraries that keep TypeScript Cashu support robust and
give developers a toolkit for integrating ecash into new applications.

### Krux-Installer

We have [supported the krux-installer project in the past], and this additional
support goes to developer [joazinhom] for his work on the installer and its
platform reach. Krux is open-source firmware that turns inexpensive [Kendryte
K210 devices] into air-gapped Bitcoin signing devices, and Krux-installer is the
desktop application that flashes and upgrades this firmware on supported
hardware. The installer replaces complicated command-line tools with a guided
GUI so non-technical users can install and update Krux from official releases on
their own devices.

With this grant, joazinhom will work on modernizing Krux-installer and expanding
its platform support by refactoring the codebase, migrating dependency
management from Poetry to UV, and adding a device registry system that reduces
duplication when onboarding new devices. He will move the build system to the
[BeeWare]/Briefcase framework to produce native installers for Android and
Flatpak-based desktops and to create a sustainable pattern for future platforms.
In the final phase, he will focus on testing and stabilizing these builds,
fixing touch and installation issues, and improving overall reliability for
users flashing and upgrading Krux devices.

### Libbitcoin

[Libbitcoin] is a C++ Bitcoin development toolkit and an alternative full node
implementation. It provides a modular node, server, and explorer stack together
with cross-platform libraries for building Bitcoin applications. The project
began in 2011 and produced the first independently implemented Bitcoin full node
separate from Bitcoin Core, and it remains under active maintenance with work
toward a version 4 release that emphasizes faster initial block download and
better scaling with modern hardware.

This grant will support work on libbitcoin v4 by developer [pmienk]. Planned
work targets an early preview of the v4 node, followed by a full release of the
node, explorer, and server components. The focus includes further optimization
of initial block download, performance scaling across available CPU, disk, and
network resources, integration and testing of the consolidated stack, and
improvements to documentation for operators and developers. The goal is a
well-engineered Bitcoin node, server, and explorer that provides an independent
implementation of the protocol and a practical toolkit for downstream
applications.

### Noah

Noah is a self-custodial mobile wallet for [Ark], a Layer 2 protocol, developed
by returning grantee [Hampus Sjöberg], creator of [Blixt Wallet]. Noah runs on
Android and iOS and uses Ark's virtual transaction outputs (VTXOs), so users see
a single balance that can send and receive over Lightning and on-chain. The
wallet connects to [Second's Ark client Bark] and removes channel setup,
liquidity management, and backup complexity while keeping users in control of
their keys. A working alpha already supports sending and receiving payments and
builds on years of experience operating Blixt as a non-custodial Lightning
wallet.

With this grant, Hampus will work on reliable Ark round syncing using silent
push notifications, Lightning Address and future [BIP-353] support, expanded
LNURL features, and a seed-based encrypted backup system. He will also add
receive flows that let the app accept payments while it is offline. The roadmap
adds auxiliary Lightning and nostr integrations such as the LNURL protocol
suite, WebLN, Nostr Wallet Connect, payments via nostr profiles, and Tor support
for privacy. Alongside Noah, Blixt will shift toward a power-user wallet with
planned features including BOLT12 support tied to the upcoming `lnd` release,
offline receive, faster chain sync, desktop builds for Windows and Linux,
Lightning/on-chain swaps, LSP-spec support, and interface improvements.

### Rust-Bitcoin

Through this grant, we [continue our support] for `rust-bitcoin` projects by
providing additional funding to developer [mpbagot] for his work on the library,
which provides Rust types and utilities for serializing, parsing, and executing
Bitcoin protocol messages, blocks, transactions, scripts, keys, addresses, and
PSBTs in Rust applications. The library sits at the center of the [rust-bitcoin
organization] together with crates such as `rust-secp256k1`, `bitcoin_hashes`,
`rust-miniscript`, and client libraries for Bitcoin Core, and it underpins
projects like Bitcoin Dev Kit, Lightning Dev Kit, electrs and Fedimint.

This grant will support work on upcoming releases of the main bitcoin crate and
related primitives, bug fixes, expanded test coverage, documentation
improvements, and refactoring across the crate set. Bagot will continue his
existing cleanup patches and will take on larger tasks aimed at stable 1.0
releases of key crates in the ecosystem. The goal is a well-tested,
well-documented, and CC0-licensed Rust Bitcoin stack with stable APIs for
downstream projects.

### Stratum V2

Our [support for Stratum V2 continues] with a new grant to developer [Lucas
Balieiro] for his work on the Stratum V2 Reference Implementation (SRI),
focusing on stability, testing, and developer tooling. SRI is the Rust reference
implementation of the Stratum V2 mining protocol and provides core libraries and
pool and miner applications for encrypted, decentralized pooled mining. It
powers roles such as pool servers, miners, and job declaration clients and
serves as the main open-source codebase for adopters of Stratum V2 in production
mining setups.

With this grant, Balieiro will improve SRI's testing infrastructure and adopter
experience. Planned work includes expanding the continuous testing tool for
long-running cross-implementation sessions, raising low-level crate test
coverage from roughly 25% toward 40%, and updating documentation alongside new
tests. He will build a unified command-line interface for launching SRI
applications, add Docker support and binary releases for easier deployment, and
streamline CI workflows to integrate the new testing tools. The roadmap also
covers compatibility testing with other Stratum V2 stacks and community work,
such as mentoring contributors and running educational sessions with the
Brazilian Bitcoin community.
