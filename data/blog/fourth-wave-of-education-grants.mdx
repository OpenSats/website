We are excited to announce our latest wave of grants from our [Education
Initiative](/blog/announcing-the-opensats-education-initiative), which is
dedicated to advancing Bitcoin literacy and community development across the
globe. These grants represent our ongoing commitment to supporting projects that
make Bitcoin education more accessible, practical, and useful.

Whether training the next generation of developers in their local languages,
creating censorship-resistant content, or expanding grassroots curriculum, each
project in this wave aims to empower individuals and communities with the tools
and understanding necessary to participate in the growing Bitcoin ecosystem.  

This wave of grants is made possible by the generosity of our donors, whose
support enables us to fund impactful educational initiatives. Educational
content produced by these projects will be published under permissive and open
licenses, ensuring it remains accessible to anyone.

Here are the three projects receiving grants in this wave:

- [Librería de Satoshi](#librería-de-satoshi)
- [Crack the Orange](#crack-the-orange)
- [FREE Madeira](#free-madeira)

Each of these projects brings unique value to the global Bitcoin community. We
are proud to support their efforts and look forward to seeing the impact they
will have in their respective regions and beyond.

Let's take a closer look at these projects and see how they align with our
[mission](/mission).

### Librería de Satoshi

Librería de Satoshi is a technical school working to make Bitcoin development an
accessible career path for people across Latin America and the Caribbean. Their
programs provide real-time, cohort-based technical training in Spanish. Over the
past three years, Librería de Satoshi has trained over 1,000 people across 26
countries. Its curriculum covers Bitcoin Script, the Bitcoin protocol, nostr,
Lightning payments, and bitcoin self-custody. Alumni have gone on to launch
bitcoin businesses, contribute to open-source projects like Bitcoin Core,
SeedSigner, and Fedimint, teach at universities, and work at companies such as
Debifi and Tether. Some have even taken on public service roles, including
within El Salvador's National Commission of Digital Assets.

With support from this grant, Librería de Satoshi will expand its curriculum
into new languages, offering courses in both Portuguese and English for the
first time. The team plans to incorporate game-based and design-driven learning
strategies across its offerings and introduce new classes, including personal
finance courses for women—taught in Spanish—and a self-custody course
available both online and in person. The project will continue helping students
and alumni gain access to bitcoin-related job opportunities and open-source
projects.

### Crack the Orange

Launched in 2023 with [support from
OpenSats](/blog/bitcoin-grants-december-2023#crack-the-orange), Crack the Orange
is educating the next generation of bitcoin community builders in the Global
South. The program runs a year-long course that includes monthly calls, online
assessments, scholarships, and a sats-based rewards system to encourage
completion and engagement. The curriculum takes a non-partisan, humanitarian
approach, emphasizing bitcoin's potential to serve people across political and
social lines. To date, 37 graduates from 14 countries—including Ghana, Kenya,
Nigeria, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe—have completed the program. Several
graduates are already making an impact, including Marcel Lorraine of [Bitcoin
Dada](https://btcdada.com/about/), Sarah White of [African
Bitcoiners](https://bitcoiners.africa/about-us/), and Megasley of [Free Routing
Africa](https://freerouting.africa/about-us/), among others.

With support from this grant, Crack the Orange will enhance access to its
curriculum by embedding its full library of educational videos—originally hosted
on YouTube—into a searchable archive on the Crack the Orange
[website](http://my.cracktheorange.com). The team will also publish course
transcripts and materials to GitHub to support broader reuse and localization,
and continue efforts to expand language accessibility—through human-reviewed
translation workflows. In doing so, Crack the Orange aims to make its curriculum
more accessible, resilient, and inclusive for a growing global audience.

### FREE Madeira

FREE Madeira is a non-profit organization dedicated to advancing Bitcoin
education and adoption in the Madeira Archipelago, Portugal. The project
supports locals and businesses through their transition from fiat to sound money
while working to position Madeira as a leading hub for Bitcoin and
sustainability. They offer a 3-hour introductory workshop to teach locals the
basics of fiat currency, Bitcoin, and financial sovereignty. FREE Madeira has
been translating educational materials from partners like [Looking Glass
Education](https://lookingglasseducation.com/) and is currently developing a new
website to host these resources. They also participate in the [Mi Primer
Bitcoin](/blog/announcing-the-opensats-education-initiative#mi-primer-bitcoin)
node program to help bring long-form Bitcoin education to the local community.

With support from this grant, FREE Madeira will expand its educational programs
by launching a 10-week "Bitcoin Diploma" course in Portuguese, combining
recorded lessons with weekly live virtual discussions. They will also introduce
their first merchant-focused workshop, tailored to the needs of local business
owners exploring Bitcoin adoption. The course will include advanced content, and
all educational materials—video content and manuals—will be freely
accessible via their website and published under a Creative Commons license.
