Dez is a loving husband, father, and veteran and is passionate about freedom
technology. He is currently a consultant and enjoys learning more about bitcoin
whenever possible.

He was one of the first volunteers to join OpenSats and has been helping our
initiative even during his service (when he wasn't stuck on a boat in the high
seas).
