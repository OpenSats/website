Dez is a loving husband, father, and veteran and is passionate about freedom
technology. He is currently a consultant and enjoys learning more about bitcoin
whenever possible.

He was one of the first [volunteers] to join OpenSats and has been helping our
initiative even during his service (when he wasn't stuck on a boat in the high
seas).
