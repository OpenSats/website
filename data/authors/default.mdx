Open Sats Initiative, Inc. (EIN 85-2722249) is a 501(c)(3) public charity which
aims to fund Bitcoin-related free and open-source projects and associated
education and research initiatives.

We want to see contributors to Bitcoin and FOSS (free and open-source) tools
supported by a sustainable ecosystem and consistent funding, so we set up a
platform to do just that. Donors can come to the OpenSats web platform and
either recommend gifts to [specific projects](/projects) or contribute to our
[general fund][gf].

Grants are distributed quarterly by our board. We evaluate and assess
applications to make sure any grants are awarded to high impact projects in the
Bitcoin space. We distribute grants to a wide variety of contributor types
(developers, designers, researchers, educators, reviewers, and the like), but
only to those working on Bitcoin and open-source projects that will improve
public access to Bitcoin infrastructure.

# Board of Directors

We didn't want any one person or small group to have control of the decision
making process of OpenSats, so we created a transparent, public-facing, and
accountable nine-person board to make all organizational decisions. OpenSats'
board members have deep-seated values and will stop at nothing to support and
ensure the survival of free and open-source technology like Bitcoin.

# Operations

Our operations team ensures that OpenSats remains the well-oiled sat-dispensing
machine that it is today.

Unlike most charities, OpenSats doesn't take a percentage of any donations for
our operational budget. This means that our small operation budget is funded
from donors like you. If you'd like to contribute specifically to the operations
budget which helps OpenSats function and support other FOSS projects and
contributors in the space, please consider donating to our [Operations
Budget](https://opensats.org/projects/opensats_operations_budget).

# Volunteers

In addition to the operational team, we have a small but dedicated group of
volunteers that are helping the initiative in a variety of ways.

individuals and from companies, as well from the bitcoin and open-source
community at large.
