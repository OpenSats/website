Open Sats Initiative, Inc. (EIN 85-2722249) is a 501(c)(3) public charity which
aims to fund Bitcoin-related free and open-source projects and associated
education and research initiatives.

We want to see contributors to Bitcoin and FOSS (free and open-source) tools
supported by a sustainable ecosystem and consistent funding, so we set up a
platform to do just that. Donors can come to the OpenSats web platform and
either recommend gifts to specific project areas or contribute to our general
fund.

Grants are distributed quarterly by our board. We evaluate and assess
applications to make sure any grants are awarded to high impact projects in the
Bitcoin space. We distribute grants to a wide variety of contributor types
(developers, designers, researchers, educators, reviewers, and the like), but
only to those working on Bitcoin and open-source projects that will improve
public access to Bitcoin infrastructure.

We didn't want any one person or small group to have control of the decision
making process of OpenSats, so we created a transparent, public-facing, and
accountable nine-person board to make all organizational decisions. OpenSats'
board members have deep-seated values and will stop at nothing to support and
ensure the survival of free and open-source technology like Bitcoin.
