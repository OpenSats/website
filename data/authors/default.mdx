Open Sats Initiative, Inc. (EIN 85-2722249) is a 501(c)(3) public charity which
aims to fund Bitcoin-related free and open-source projects and associated
education and research initiatives.

We want to see contributors to Bitcoin and FOSS (free and open-source) tools
supported by a sustainable ecosystem and consistent funding, so we set up a
platform to do just that. Donors can come to the OpenSats web platform and
either recommend gifts to specific project areas or contribute to our general
fund.

We distribute grants to a wide variety of contributor types (developers,
designers, researchers, educators, reviewers, and the like), but only to those
working on Bitcoin and open-source projects that will improve public access to
Bitcoin infrastructure.
