Julian's life experiences taught him the value of self-sovereignty. When he
found Bitcoin, it opened his eyes to how technology can be used to enhance
privacy and freedom instead of controlling others. Since then, Julian enjoys
testing different self-sovereign tools, understanding the technical details
behind how they work, and implementing his favorite tools in his everyday
life. His professional experience is in marketing and he aims to work for a
Bitcoin company that aligns with his values.

Julian also enjoys eating healthy, trying out food from different cultures, and
studying how Bitcoin is merging into the international financial system.
