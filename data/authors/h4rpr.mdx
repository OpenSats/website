Harper entered the Bitcoin ecosystem in 2020 at [BTC, Inc.](https://b.tc/) Most
recently, he was a venture associate for the company’s capital allocation
vehicle, [UTXO Management](https://www.utxo.management/), where he helped
establish the [Bitcoin Magazine Ecosystem
Fund](https://venture.angellist.com/v/back/the-bitcoin-magazine-2140-venture-fund).
Prior to that he was an operations associate for The Bitcoin Conference,
contributing his organizational efforts on the programming team for [Bitcoin

microbiology with a focus on laboratory research at the University of Alabama.

Harper joined the OpenSats team part-time in 2022 to oversee the initiative’s
operations, and in 2023 dedicated his full focus to scaling the organization in
an effort to increase funding for bitcoin and FOSS development.
