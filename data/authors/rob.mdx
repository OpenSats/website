Rob believes Bitcoin will continue to transform the world for the better. He
initially wrote off Bitcoin as he didn't see how it could fulfill the promises
of the white paper. Once he spent the time to better understand Bitcoin and the
Lightning network, he couldn't help but go deeper. Rob is an experienced
software project manager who has led projects across the globe. He hopes that
his work at OpenSats can help progress the Bitcoin and Nostr ecosystems so that
more people globally have access to the world's best money and the beauty of
decentralized communication. With these tools, he believes that we can build
stronger communities and resist those who wish to control our freedoms.

Rob loves seeing the world, meeting new people, and reading. When he isn't
learning about Bitcoin or macroeconomics, he is immersed in learning Japanese in the
mountains of Japan.
