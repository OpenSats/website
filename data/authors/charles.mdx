Charles might strike the uninitiated as a very boring man. As the son of an
accountant and a librarian turned bureaucrat, he grew up immersed in a world of
spreadsheets and paper-pushing. But he is not a boring man. He has a very
particular set of skills; skills he has acquired over a very long career. Skills
that make him effective at navigating the nightmare of bureaucracy.

As a volunteer, he is currently sitting in an undisclosed location pushing
papers from the left side of his desk to the right side of his desk, while also
pushing Bitcoin and freedom-tech forward by providing his fiat expertise to
OpenSats.

He is a professional when it comes to navigating the old world; the world that
honors hand-written signatures over cryptographic ones; the world that accepts
documents only if they are faxed via an ancient, government-approved machine. We
are working towards making that world obsolete; but until we do, organizations
like us need help from people like Charles.
