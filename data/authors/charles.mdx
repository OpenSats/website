Charles might strike the uninitiated as a very boring man. As the son of an
accountant and a librarian turned bureaucrat, he grew up immersed in a world of
spreadsheets and paper-pushing. But he is not a boring man. He has a very
particular set of skills; skills he has acquired over a very long career. Skills
that make him effective at navigating the nightmare of bureaucracy.

As Chief Fiat Officer, Charles takes care of (surprise, surprise!) the "fiat" side
of the initiative. He is currently sitting in an undisclosed location pushing
papers from the left side of his desk to the right side of his desk, while also
pushing Bitcoin and freedom-tech forward by providing his fiat expertise to
OpenSats.

He is a professional when it comes to navigating the old world; the world that
honors hand-written signatures over cryptographic ones; the world that accepts
documents only if they are faxed via an ancient, government-approved machine. We
are working towards making that world obsolete; but until we do, organizations
like us need people like Charles.
