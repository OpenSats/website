Lucas is the co-founder of several small businesses, some of which he is
managing to this day. His entrepreneurial endeavors over the last 20 years
spanned multiple countries and continents. As is usually the case with small
business operators, he knows a little bit of everything and likes to get things
done.

Because of his first-hand experience with hyperinflation and running businesses in extremely volatile economic and political environments, he developed a passion for Bitcoin and has been
studying the orange coin and related freedom tech as intensely as his spare time
allows. As the first and longest-standing volunteer of OpenSats, he is now
making a valuable contribution to the Bitcoin and wider open-source ecosystem.
