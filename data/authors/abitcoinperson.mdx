Ben is a Bitcoiner. He started [OpenSats](https://opensats.org/), a 100%
pass-through non-profit org focusing on funding contributors to Bitcoin and
related FOSS projects, and [The Bitcoin Company](https://thebitcoincompany.com),
a Bitcoin-only fintech focused on bringing privacy-focused financial products to
the world.

Ben loves game theory, privacy, freedom tech, and Bitcoin. He also has a deep
disdain for “charities” that siphon off donations for their often lavish
operational expenditures, so he created OpenSats as a transparent and efficient
100% pass-through organization which attempts to help solve the free rider
problem within the FOSS contributor space by creating a more sustainable
ecosystem of builders and by ensuring that every cent or sat donated goes
directly through to those giving back.

He hopes that, with your support, OpenSats will continue to fund builders on
Bitcoin and other FOSS projects generously giving their time to build the tools
which will help separate government from money, avoid a world of CBDCs, and
accelerate the inevitable and overdue adoption of freedom tech and a fair money
for the world.
