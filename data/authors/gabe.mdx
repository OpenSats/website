Gabe works as an analyst in the healthcare industry and spends most of his time
working with hospital foundations. He first became interested in OpenSats when
he realized that sometimes the best thing you can do is to help those who are
experts at what they do. Gabe believes in the future of Bitcoin and Nostr and
wants to help developers and contributors to make that future a reality.
