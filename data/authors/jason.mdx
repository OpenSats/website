Jason, like the characters in _The Matrix_, felt from an early age there was
something wrong with the world.

In a journey characterized by a grounding in natural/experimental science, a
curiosity in economics driven by the financial crisis of 2007-8, a career in
government and the private sector as a Ph.D. applied microeconomist, he finally
discovered Austrian economics and Bitcoin.

Unable to unsee the horrors of the fiat system (which he had been captured by
during his years in academia, government, and more generally as a mainstream
economist), he departed his fiat career to spend time on more worthy pursuits.
An avid user and supporter of FOSS, he happily dedicates his time now to his
family, Bitcoin, freedom and free speech, and FOSS through OpenSats.

He also does what he can to add a little more structure and beauty to the world
by playing Bach and Mozart on the violin (in addition to running his Bitcoin
node, of course).
