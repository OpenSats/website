Dread is a Jamaican Bitcoiner with a passion for freedom technology and
individual sovereignty. When people think of what it means to be Jamaican, they
picture beaches and waterfalls, spicy jerk chicken, Bob Marley and the
Rastafarian movement. But Dread, like Jamaica, is so much more than that. Yes
Dread loves Reggae and jerk chicken. Yes he loves the beaches and waterfalls of
his homeland, and yes, he has dreadlocks and often gives praise to the Most
High. But those things are only part of what makes Dread who he is. 

Dread comes from a family of engineers that instilled in him a great respect for
the merits of hard work. He worked hard at every opportunity that came his way.
He became a champion pole vaulter and national record holder, holds a dual
master's degree in computer and electrical engineering, and had a 20+ year
career in information technology consulting working for some of the top
consulting firms in the world before founding a boutique technology consulting
firm of his own.

Like many Bitcoiners, Dread didn’t find Bitcoin; Bitcoin found him. Bitcoin
represents the fusion of Dread’s interests and ideals. Bitcoin is hope for
Jamaica, and for individuals the world over. When he realized the need for
global awareness, he switched his attention and energy to developing and
promoting Bitcoin.

He has written several travel articles for Bitcoin Magazine, writing tips on
where to go and what to do when nomadic Bitcoiners are travelling to various
cities around the world. He also does his own personal gobetrotting, visiting
new and budding bitcoin communities in many parts of the world, volunteering his
time and knowledge to help grow the Bitcoin circular economy.

Dread also contributes to several open source projects in the Bitcoin space,
focusing on applications and services that allow anyone to run open source
software on their own self-hosted server. He was involved in the creation and
growth of Plebnet, a free and open online lightning community focused on helping
the everyday man and woman to get started running their own lightning node.

Dread now hosts a new web series and podcast, titled “One Love Bitcoin.” For
Dread, “One Love Bitcoin” is more than just a show. It is a mantra, his mission
and a way of life. He hopes to interview Bitcoiners from every country on earth,
to share their stories, and in so doing, help to bring about an exodus from the
failed fiat monetary experiment to the bright orange future made possible by
Bitcoin.
