Gigi is the author of 21 Lessons, a popular book about lessons learned from
falling down the Bitcoin rabbit hole. His current work-in-progress book, 21
Ways, tries to illuminate Bitcoin from multiple angles, using metaphors from
biology, physics, engineering, and other disciplines. He is the creator and
maintainer of bitcoin-resources.com, a comprehensive list of curated books,
articles, podcasts, and other resources that help to provide a multi-faceted
understanding of Bitcoin. In 2019 he launched the German-speaking Bitcoin
podcast "Einundzwanzig" with one of his co-hosts which turned into a community
movement that now spans multiple countries. He is passionate about privacy,
human rights, and freedom technology. As the head of strategy and operations at
OpenSats, he spends most of his day thinking about how to best support the
development of free and open-source software as we transition towards an
increasingly bitcoinized world.
