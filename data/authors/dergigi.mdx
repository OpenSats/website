Gigi is the author of [21 Lessons](https://21lessons.com/), a popular book about
lessons learned from falling down the Bitcoin rabbit hole. His current
work-in-progress book, [21 Ways](https://21-ways.com/), tries to illuminate
Bitcoin from multiple angles, using metaphors from biology, physics,
engineering, and other disciplines. He is the creator and maintainer
of [bitcoin-resources.com](https://bitcoin-resources.com/), a comprehensive list
of curated books, articles, podcasts, and other resources that help to provide a
multi-faceted understanding of Bitcoin. In 2019 he launched the German-speaking
Bitcoin podcast \"[Einundzwanzig](https://einundzwanzig.space/)\" with one of
his co-hosts which turned into a community movement that now spans [multiple
countries](https://twentyone.world/). He is passionate about privacy, human
rights, and freedom technology. As the head of strategy and operations at
OpenSats, he spends most of his day thinking about how to best support the
development of free and open-source software as we transition towards an
increasingly bitcoinized world.
