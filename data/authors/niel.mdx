Niel is an Industrial Designer that got into regenerative farming because he saw
no way out of the inflationary debt spiral we find ourselves in. After properly
having been exposed to how Bitcoin fixes this and then discovering how nostr
builds an interoperable web on top of it, heâ€™s [now bringing] his years of making
beautiful and convincing presentations for his Industrial Designs to the world
of nostr UI/UX.

Family, Farming and Freedom Tech are what drive him.
