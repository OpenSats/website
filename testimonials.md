## Satoshi Nakamoto on Bitcoin

> Being open source means anyone can independently review the code. If it was
> closed source, nobody could verify the security. I think it's essential for a
> program of this nature to be open source.

## John Gribbin

> Core Lightning's plugin ecosystem contains powerful tools like CLBOSS for
> automated liquidity management and BOLT12 Prisms for payment splitting, but
> interacting with these plugins requires command-line knowledge. Remote solves
> this by providing the first comprehensive plugin dashboard. We also decided to
> make Remote fully self-hostable. Now users can run their complete Lightning
> stack on Start9—Bitcoin node, CLN, and plugin interfaces—entirely on their
> own hardware with intuitive access to advanced features.

## Steve Myers, BDK director/core contributor

> The mission of the BDK team is to provide the best FOSS libraries for building
> secure, modern bitcoin apps and services. With the 1.0+ releases now in the
> hands of thousands of users through projects like
> [Bitkey](https://github.com/proto-at-block/bitkey) and
> [ProtonWallet](https://github.com/ProtonWallet), we have begun to achieve this
> mission. Moreover, with projects like
> [AnchorWatch](https://www.anchorwatch.com/),
> [FrostSnap](https://github.com/frostsnap/frostsnap),
> [Cove](https://github.com/bitcoinppl/cove), and [Bitcoin
> Safe](https://github.com/andreasgriffin/bitcoin-safe), we continue to support
> innovative new layer one wallets. Looking forward, we also see BDK playing a
> strong supporting role for layer two projects like
> [ldk-node](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/ldk-node) and [Second's
> bark](https://gitlab.com/ark-bitcoin/bark). If there is a bitcoin project you
> want to see in the world, BDK will help you build it.

## Jamil Lambert

> Testing is an important part of software development, which isn't always
> treated as such. There are often poorly written tests that are hard to read, and

> the missed mutants requires an understanding of what the code being tested does,
> which has been a good way to learn about the software while also doing something

## Misovan

> Thanks to the OpenSats grant, I was able to focus on the niche area of offline
> ecash payments. For those of us used to fast internet, this may seem like a
> curiosity, but in many underdeveloped regions it's a real necessity. Minibits
> has become a pioneer in showcasing the unique properties of ecash for moving
> bitcoin. The wallet enables the payer to be completely offline, leveraging
> ecash's nature as a true bearer token stored directly in the wallet.

## Vitor Pamplona

> This achievement (outbox transition and relay changes) is a major
> demonstration of the true decentralized potential of nostr. By enabling mobile
> clients to automatically connect to 1,000 relays, we have fundamentally

> highly distributed network—not just a few central points.

## Hodlbod

> Much of nostr's novelty has to do with keys and digital signatures. But
> focusing on the cryptographic aspects is, to me, actually something of a
> distraction. The important thing to realize is that digital signatures make
> relays possible—I mean this in the sense that digital signatures decouple data
> storage from data authentication. This means that the same information can be
> stored in multiple places—whether relays, local files, torrents, or anywhere
> else—and the names associated with these places lose their power and become
> far less meaningful. This puts the user in control, by allowing them to select
> and move between services and custodians, with support from the protocol for
> doing so.

## Fabian

> One of the goals with Nostur is to provide a social media alternative that is
> free from manipulative algorithms, free from ad-based algorithms that
> prioritize engagement or promote doom scrolling. I think this has worked out

> that things aren't pushed on you. I open Nostur to see what the people I
> follow have to say and not to become a target of an ad campaign.
