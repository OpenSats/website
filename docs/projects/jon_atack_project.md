## About this project

Since the beginning, I have consistently been one of the most active contributors and reviewers on all areas of Bitcoin Core (top 4 committer, currently #15 all time), working and reviewing to move high-impact projects forward wherever needed. I also write and review for Bitcoin Optech and co-maintain the Bitcoin Core PR Review Club website and twitter account.

I would continue to work consistently as one of the most prolific committers and reviewers on Bitcoin Core.
