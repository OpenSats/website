The OpenSats Nostr Fund is a way for you to support the development and
improvement of the Nostr protocol and related software. The fund is made up of
donations from individuals and organizations.

The fund is used to support projects that make Nostr more accessible, secure,
and decentralized. It also helps to educate people about Nostr and its potential.

If you want to help, you can donate sats or fiat currency to the fund [here](#top).
