## About this project

Zeus lets you take lightning on the go and provides a best in class experience for full node operators running LND, c-lightning, or Eclair. Manage your channels, send and receive on-chain and LN transactions, or manage your routing strategy right in your pocket. Tor is built in to allow you to connect home securely to your nodeâ€™s hidden services with minimal hassle.
