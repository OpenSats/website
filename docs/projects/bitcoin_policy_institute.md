## About this project

The prevailing narrative in Washington is that Bitcoin harms the environment, threatens national security, and hurts consumers — helping only criminals and speculators. Left unchecked, these narratives will continue to form the tailwinds for policy with grave consequences for American Bitcoiners. Since forming in January, the Bitcoin Policy Institute has been advancing a different vision in D.C.– one of an America strengthened by Bitcoin. 

BPI was instrumental in responding to the Biden Executive Order on Digital Assets, providing in-depth reports detailing the benefits of Bitcoin and meeting privately with White House officials to offer guidance on key issues. They facilitated a groundbreaking letter to Congress from 21 global human rights leaders explaining how Bitcoin saves lives and protects those facing political repression and economic crisis. Moving forward, BPI hopes to bolster its presence in Washington and expand its research and advocacy. 

BPI is a non-partisan, nonprofit organization formed under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code.
