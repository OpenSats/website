OpenSats is a 501(c)(3) public charity that aims to support and maintain a
sustainable ecosystem of funding for free and open-source projects and
contributors, especially Bitcoin related projects and projects which help
Bitcoin flourish.

We believe that free and open-source software is essential to the future of the
internet and the world. It allows people to collaborate and share knowledge,
without being locked into proprietary software or hardware. This is especially
important for Bitcoin, which  relies on the open-source development community to
maintain and improve its software.
