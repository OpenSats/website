## About this project

I have been working on Bitcoin code for five years and 1.5 years ago I decided to dedicate myself to programming for the Lightning network. I began by learning about Lightning in depth and making contributions to the CoreLightning project. I felt particularly accomplished rooting out some complex flakiness bugs and porting the project to MacOS. You can see my work here: https://tinyurl.com/3tcdafbe. I had heard of splicing in 2018 and saw it making the news rounds last year. On Clubhouse and Twitter Spaces bitcoiners were talking excitedly about using submarine swaps and I suggested people use splicing instead! The confused silence was palpable, no one had heard about it all. Diving in I realized only the splicing spec had been released — no one had actually written the code! So I decided I would take on the work of coding up the first implementation. By March of this year I had made the world’s first splice and published it on chain! You can see it here: https://twitter.com/dusty_daemon/status/1522413475909316610. Since then I have been working on finishing up the proper & complete splice implementation. The code is now in a beta state which you can see here: https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning/pull/5675. I’m looking for funding to finish the code to a polished state, build a thorough testing framework, evangelize to companies that would benefit from splicing, and bring the implementation to the other Lightning node code bases.
